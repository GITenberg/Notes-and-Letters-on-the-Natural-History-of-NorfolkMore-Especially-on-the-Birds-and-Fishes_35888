<p>The excellent Memoir of Sir Thomas Browne, in Wilkin's Edition of his
works, renders it unnecessary here to repeat what has already been so
well done; suffice it to say that he was born in London on the 19th of
October, 1605; he was educated at Winchester School and entered at
Broadgates Hall (now Pembroke College), Oxford, in 1623; graduated B.A.
31st January, 1626-7, and M.A. 11th June, 1629. About the year 1633 he
was created Doctor of Physick at Leyden. In 1636 he took up his
residence in Norwich, in 1637 was incorporated Doctor of Physic in
Oxford, and in 1665 was chosen an Honorary Fellow of the College of
Physicians. In 1671 Browne was knighted at Norwich by Charles II., and
after a useful and honourable career died on his seventy-sixth birthday,
the 19th of October, 1682, and his body lies buried in the church of St.
Peter Mancroft, Norwich.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>Browne in early life travelled much and was a voluminous writer; he made
many friendships with men celebrated in his day, and his advice and
assistance were sought and gratefully acknowledged by Dugdale, Evelyn,
Ray and Willughby, Merrett, Sir Robert Paston (afterwards Earl of
Yarmouth), Ashmole, Aubrey, and others; but his general correspondence
does not now concern us, my object being to supply in a convenient form
what I believe will be acceptable to modern naturalists, namely, an
accurate transcript of his notes and letters on the "Natural History of
the County of Norfolk."</p>

<p>These notes and letters were first published by Simon Wilkin in his
Edition of Sir Thomas Browne's Works in 1835, but they were not treated
from a naturalist's point of view, and in some places were not correctly
transcribed, added to which, in the vast mass of matter contained in
Wilkin's four large volumes (or in the closely printed three volumes of
Bohn's Edition), these interesting passages are in danger of being
overlooked or are inconvenient for reference. Two letters, moreover,
were needed to make the correspondence with Merrett complete, and these
I have been enabled to supply. I hope also that my explanatory notes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
which I trust will not be deemed too voluminous, will be found more
useful than the necessarily brief notes furnished by Wilkin and his
collaborators. Furthermore, I think that the retention of the original
spelling and punctuation may lend a charm to the quaintness of the
language which is in a measure destroyed by any attempt at modernising.</p>

<p>There is much that is interesting bearing upon Natural Science scattered
throughout Browne's writings, especially in his <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>,
or inquiries into Vulgar and Common Errors, first published in 1646, and
the reader cannot fail to be impressed not only with the extent of his
classical knowledge but also with the shrewdness with which he pursued
his original investigations; but here it is only proposed to deal with
certain manuscript notes and a series of rough notes for, or copies of,
letters addressed to Dr. Christopher Merrett, the author of the <i>Pinax
Rerum Naturalium Britannicarum</i>. These, as remarked by their editor,
with regard to some other manuscripts published<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> in 1684, under the
title of "Certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> Miscellany Tracts," were doubtless "rather the
<i>diversions</i> than the <i>Labours</i> of his Pen; and &hellip; He did, as it
were, drop down his Thoughts of a sudden, in those spaces of vacancy
which he snatch'd from those very many occasions which gave him hourly
interruption;" but I cannot in this instance agree with the conclusion
arrived at by the same writer that it "seemeth probable that He designed
them for publick use," for they appear to be the rough drafts or
memoranda used in the production of the finished letters (which are
unfortunately not forthcoming), and were never intended for publication
in their present crude form, thus rendering pardonable such annotations
as I have ventured to add. But before proceeding further it is necessary
to consider briefly the time and circumstances under which they were
written, and the state of what passed for Natural Science at that
period.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> The "Miscellany Tracts" were put forth by "Tho. Tenison"
(1636-1715), who afterwards became Archbishop of Canterbury, but was
then the Rector of a London parish, St. Martin-in-the-Fields. He had
been a Norwich school-boy, and subsequently minister of St. Peter's
Mancroft. He was doubtless well acquainted with Browne and his family,
and hence his reference in the preface quoted to "the <i>Lady</i> and <i>Son</i>
of the excellent Authour," who, he says, "deliver'd" the papers to him.</p></div>

<p>Browne wrote early in the second half of the seventeenth century, during
a period of great awakening in the study of Nature. Hitherto it could
hardly be said that a direct appeal to the works of Nature had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span> the
prevailing method. Aristotle was still the established authority, and
commentaries on his works occupied the minds of men to the exclusion of
original investigation, notwithstanding that this great philosopher had
himself, both by precept and example, urged the importance of direct
observation and inquiry; the Mediæval school of thought still prevailed
and cramped every effort at progress. How keenly Browne lamented this
spirit of slavish adherence to tradition may be judged from a passage in
one of his Essays in the "Vulgar Errors" condemning the obstinate
adherence unto antiquity; he writes, "but the mortallist enemy unto
knowledge, and that which hath done the greatest execution upon truth,
hath been a peremptory adhesion unto authority; and more especially the
establishing of our belief upon the dictates of antiquity. For (as every
capacity may observe) most men of ages present, so supersticiously do
look upon ages past, that the authorities of one exceed the reason of
the other." In another place he argues that the present should be the
age of authority, seeing that we possess all the wisdom of the ancients
which has come down to us, with that of our own times added. In fact,
Browne's motto appears to have been "prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> all things and hold fast
only to that which is good."<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> There was one form of ancient authority before which Browne
bowed down with absolute and unquestioning submission&mdash;the authority of
the Scriptures. In all secular matters he was ever ready to point the
lance and do battle, but all that appealed to him on what he regarded as
divine authority was beyond the pale, and it never entered into his mind
to submit it to the test of reason. In the "Religio Medici" he declares
his devoted adherence first to the guidance of Scripture, and secondly
to the Articles of the Church, "whatsoever is beyond, as points
indifferent, I observe according to the rules of my private reason;" and
again, "where the Scripture is silent, the Church is my text; where that
speaks 'tis but my comment; where there is a joint silence of both I
borrow not the rules of my religion from Rome or Geneva, but the
dictates of my own reason." This implicit adherence to the literal text
of Scripture led to his&mdash;shall I say active belief in, or passive
acceptance of, the existence of Witchcraft, and thus to the only act in
an otherwise blameless life which we must regard with regret and
astonishment. I refer to the consenting part he took in the doing to
death of two poor women at Bury St. Edmund's in the year 1664. It is my
business to act as Browne's exponent, not as his apologist, but it must
be borne in mind that in his day the "higher criticism" was a thing
unheard of, and that the literal sense of the English translation of the
Bible was accepted as binding not only by him but by the vast majority
of the people, including the most learned men of the time. "Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to live" was a plain command, and given a witch the
believer's duty was also plain; that there <i>had</i> been witches there was
ample scriptural evidence, but there was none that the days of
witchcraft had passed away. Browne only shared this belief with his
pious friend, the venerable Bishop Hall, and many men equally devout
according to their lights; he makes no secret of the fact and acts in
accordance with his convictions and the plain authority of Scripture.
Thus it came about that these conscientious but mistaken men were
induced to render possible, if not actually to countenance, the fiendish
cruelties perpetrated by their unscrupulous allies. In matters which he
considered less authoritative his views were so liberal as to gain for
him the stigma of infidel or heretic; but let a man govern his thoughts
and actions by the private rules Browne laid down for his own guidance
(vol. iv., p. 420), and it would be hard to regard him as otherwise than
a God-fearing man, striving to live up to his profession.</p></div>

<p>Aristotle, whose works on Natural History have descended to us in a very
imperfect condition, lived in 385-322 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and it was not till <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 79
that the <i>Historia Naturalis</i> of Pliny the Elder the next great work,
which has survived till our days, was completed, and by some of those
most competent to form a judgment the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span> additions which he made were not
in all cases improvements. Other writers followed, but their productions
were of little value, and it was not till the year 1544 that William
Turner published at Cologne what Professor Newton describes as "the
first commentary on the birds mentioned by Aristotle and Pliny conceived
in anything like the spirit that moves modern Naturalists." Turner's
book is very rare and unfortunately at present beyond the reach of most
modern students. No attempt at systematic arrangement, as now
understood, was made until the <i>Histoire de la Nature des Oyseaux</i> of
Pierre Belon (Bellonius) appeared at Paris in 1555, for the much greater
work of Conrad Gesner, being the third book of his <i>Historia Animalium</i>,
which was published at Zurich in the same year, and treated of Birds,
followed, more or less closely, an alphabetical plan which brought upon
him the censure of Aldrovandus, three of whose sixteen folio volumes
forming the <i>Historia Naturalium</i> bore the title of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> <i>Ornithologiæ hoc
est de Avibus Historiæ, Libri XII.</i>, and were brought out at Bologna
between the years 1599 and 1603. The <i>Historia Naturalis</i> of John
Jonston, or "Jonstonus" (1603-1675), originally published in four
sections between the years 1649 and 1653, ran through several editions,
and was a popular book in the seventeenth century; it is frequently
referred to by Browne, but is a work of very little originality. Though
all these authors undoubtedly influenced their successors, it may be
fairly said that it was Browne's contemporaries and fellow-countrymen,
Francis Willughby and John Ray, who laid the first solid foundation of
systematic zoology in their <i>Ornithologia</i> and <i>Historia Piscium</i>,
published in 1676 and 1686 respectively; but dying in 1682, Browne was
indebted to neither of them, though he doubtless exercised much
influence over them, and he had to use the clumsy descriptive
terminology then in vogue.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> Let me illustrate this by a single
example. In one of his letters to Merrett he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> names a "little elegant
sea plant" (probably <i>Halecium halecinum</i>, a species of Hydroid
Zoophyte), "<i>Fucus marinus vertebratus pisciculi spinum referens
ichthyorachius</i>, or what you think fit." On another occasion Merrett
thus expresses his approval of Browne's efforts in this direction: "You
have very well named the <i>rutilus</i> and expressed fully the cours to bee
taken in the imposition of names, viz: the most obvious and most
peculiar difference to the ey or any other sens." We can hardly conceive
the difficulties these pioneers of Natural Science had to contend with;
the works of their predecessors were so indefinite as to be of little
value in determining species; they had to depend upon the vague
descriptions of fowlers and others; the same bird would probably be
known in half a dozen different localities by as many different names,
and since no satisfactory mode of preserving specimens had then been
discovered, examples for comparison were not available. If inextricable
confusion arose with regard to such a bird as the Osprey, well might
Browne write with regard to those less readily characterized, "I confess
for such little birds I am much unsatisfied on the names given to many
by countrymen, and uncertaine what to give them myself, or to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
classis of authors cleerly to reduce them. Surely there are many found
among us which are not described; and therefore such which you cannot
well reduce, may (if at all) be set down after the exacter nomination of
small birds as yet of uncertain class of knowledge."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> In 1735 appeared the first edition of the <i>Systema Naturæ
of Linnæus</i> which, meagre as it was, ushered in a more definite system
of classification, whilst his invention of the binomial method of
nomenclature, first used by him in the tenth edition of that work
published in 1758, contributed not a little in reducing to order what
had hitherto been a chaos, although in his classification of birds he
for the most part followed his predecessor Ray.</p></div>

<p>I must ask pardon for this digression, but my object has been to show
the difficulties Browne had to contend with and to emphasise the
originality which pervades all his observations, a characteristic so
conspicuously absent in the work of most of his predecessors. I should
like also to call attention to his references to the migratory habits of
many species of birds, a phenomenon attracting little notice in his day,
but one which can be so readily observed on the coast of Norfolk. These
remarks were penned at a time when hibernation in a state of torpidity
was thoroughly believed in&mdash;an idea of which even Gilbert White a
hundred years later could not thoroughly divest himself. In his tract on
"Hawks and Falconry," Browne further says: "How far the hawks, merlins,
and wild-fowl which come unto us with a north-west [east?] wind in
Autumn, fly in a day, there is no clear account: but coming over the sea
their flight hath been long or very speedy. For I have known them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> to
light so weary on the coast, that many have been taken with dogs, and
some knocked down with staves and stones." Further than this, he knew
the seasons of their appearing&mdash;the Hobby "coming to us in the spring,"
the Merlin "about autumn." His frequent mention of anatomical
peculiarities and of his dissections of many birds and beasts clearly
prove his passion for original research, and the frequent records of the
contents of the stomachs of the birds which he had the opportunity of
examining was a mode of obtaining exact information as to the nature of
their food, which I imagine was not common in those days.</p>

<p>How highly Browne was esteemed by his contemporaries may be judged from
the acknowledgments of his assistance by Dugdale, Evelyn (who visited
him in Norwich in 1671), and others; and Ray especially mentions his
indebtedness to "the deservedly famous Sir Thomas Browne, Professor of
Physic in the City of Norwich." His letters to his son, Dr. Edward
Browne, are full of instructions as to the course of study he should
pursue, and subsequently, when the latter became celebrated and was
appointed Physician to St. Bartholomew's Hospital, it was still to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> his
father that he looked for advice in his hospital practice and in the
preparation of his lectures. Browne was proud of his adopted county, a
feeling evidently shared by his son, and I trust I may be pardoned for
quoting the concluding passage of the latter's account of a tour into
Derbyshire, wherein he expresses a sentiment which survives with
undiminished force in the breast of many a Norfolk man in the present
day. There is a very interesting account of his crossing the Wash on
leaving Lynn for Boston, but on his return to Norwich in September,
1662, he thus concludes his journal: "Give me leave to say this much:
let any stranger find mee out so pleasant a country, such good way
[roads], large heath, three such places as Norwich. Yar [Yarmouth] and
Lin [Lynn], in any county of England, and I'll bee once again a vagabond
to visit them."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> <i>Simon Wilkin</i> (1790-1862), the able editor of Sir Thomas
Browne's collected works, was born at Costessey near Norwich, in the
year 1790. He came to Norwich after his father's death in 1799, taking
up his temporary abode with his guardian, Joseph Kinghorn, a Baptist
minister of note and a prominent member of a literary circle then
existing in Norwich, by whom his education was superintended. On
arriving at man's estate and being at that time possessed of ample
means, he devoted himself to the study of Natural History, especially to
Entomology, and was the possessor of a large collection of insects
which, in the year 1827, was purchased for the Norwich Museum at a cost
of one hundred guineas, a large sum in those days. He was one of the
founders and the first librarian of the Norfolk and Norwich Literary
Institution in 1822, also of the Norfolk and Norwich Museum in 1825,
both of which institutions (the former reunited to its parent Library,
founded in 1784) are still flourishing. Wilkin was a Fellow of the
Linnean Society, also a Member of the Wernerian Society of Edinburgh. In
later years the loss of the bulk of his property by a commercial failure
necessitated his turning his attention to some means of earning a
livelihood, and he established himself in Norwich as a printer and
publisher; later in life he removed to Hampstead, where he died on 28th
July, 1862, and was buried in his native village of Costessey.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> Some copies of this Edition have a title-page, bearing the
name of H. G. Bohn as publisher, and the date of 1846, but differing
only in that respect.</p></div>

<p>The foot-notes in Wilkin's edition, many of them very curious,
initialled "Wr.," are by Dr. Christopher Wren, Dean of Windsor (father
of the Architect of St. Paul's Cathedral), and were found on the margins
of a copy of the first edition of the <i>Pseudodoxia</i> now preserved in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford; those initialled "G." were written for
Wilkin's first edition by the late Miss Anna Gurney, of Northrepps, near
Cromer, Norfolk.</p>

<p>The first papers to which I shall refer are a series of rough notes
contained for the most part in volume 1830 of the Sloane MSS., the first
portion being devoted to <i>Birds</i> found in Norfolk, followed by a similar
series relating to marine and freshwater <i>Fishes</i>, including a few
marine invertebrata and plants. They are written on one side only of
foolscap paper, the portion relating to Birds occupying folios 5 to 19
inclusive, folios 1 to 4 consist of two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> inserted letters from Merrett
to Browne (<a href="#APPENDIX_A">see Appendix A.</a>), which are printed by Wilkin in his first
edition, Vol. I., pp. 442-5. The notes on Fishes are in the same volume
of manuscripts, folios 23 to 38; but there are some irregularities which
will be explained as they occur. The whole of the notes are very roughly
written, and present the appearance of a commonplace book, in which the
entries were made as the events occurred to the writer, being quite
devoid of any system or arrangement. The entries doubtless extend over
several years, but it is impossible to fix the dates on which they were
made, the only internal evidence I can find being that speaking of the
occurrence of a certain shark he states it was taken "this year, 1662,"
and on the next page of the MS. there is the record of the occurrence of
a sun-fish in the year 1667; this latter, however, is evidently an
interpolation. A few pages further on there is the record of what he
calls a large mackerel, "taken this year, 1668," but this also is an
addition. We may take it, I think, that most of the notes were made
about the year 1662, but that they were added to on various occasions up
to 1668, in which year his first <a href="#merrett_1">letter to Merrett</a> is dated. It has been
suggested that these notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> were prepared in the interest of Dr. Merrett
for his use in an enlarged edition of his <i>Pinax</i>, but the remark in his
first letter to this correspondent, "I have observed and taken notice of
many animals in these parts whereof 3 years agoe a learned gentleman of
this country wished me to give him some account, which while I was doing
ye gentleman my good friend died," clearly shows that they were
originally prepared for another purpose, although they eventually
furnished the materials for his letters to Merrett, but who his deceased
friend was it seems now useless to conjecture, although it would be
interesting to know. The notes were certainly never intended to appear
in their present form, and failing their use by Merrett which never took
place, the information they contained was, as we know, of great service
to Ray and Willughby.</p>

<p>Browne's correspondent, Dr. Christopher Merrett, was born at Winchcomb,
in Gloucestershire, on the 16th of February, 1614. He graduated B.A. at
Oriel College, Oxford, about the year 1635; M.B. 1636; M.D. 1643. Was
elected Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1651, and was made
first Keeper of the Library and Museum; he was Censor of the College
seven times. Having entered into litigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span> with the College with
regard to his appointment, which was considered by that body to have
terminated when the Library was destroyed by the great fire, he was
defeated, and in 1681 expelled from his fellowship. He died in London in
1695. ("Dict. of Nat. Biog.") Merrett was the author of several works on
various subjects, as well as of the <i>Pinax</i>, and a translation of the
"Art of Glass" referred to further on. His <i>Pinax Rerum Naturalium
Britannicarum</i>, said to have been brought out in 1666, contained the
earliest list of British Birds ever published, but it is little more
than a bare list. Copies bearing the date of 1666 are very rare, and it
is believed the edition was burned in a fire at the publishers; but
Professor Newton ("Dict. of Birds," Introduction, p. xviii.) says that
in 1667 there were two issues of a reprint; one, nominally a second
edition, only differs from the others in having a new title-page, an
example doubtless of what Wilkin severely condemns as "that contemptible
form of lying under which publishers have endeavoured to persuade the
public of the rapidity of their sales." Merrett was contemplating a new
and improved edition of his work when, as Wilkin happily puts it, "in an
auspicious moment he sought the assistance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span> Browne, whose liberal
response is evidenced in the [drafts of the] letters still fortunately
extant, but either superseded by the more learned labours of Willughby
and Ray, or laid aside on account of the perplexities in which Merrett
became involved with the College of Physicians, the <i>Pinax</i> never
attained an enlarged edition. Had Browne completed and published his own
'Natural History of Norfolk,' he might have contended for precedency
among the writers of County Natural Histories with [his friend] Dr.
Robert Plot,<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> who published the earliest of such works&mdash;those of
Oxford and Staffordshire, in 1677 and 1686 respectively. He seems,
however, to have preferred contributing to the labours of those whom he
considered better naturalists than himself; and in his third attempt
thus to render his observations useful he had somewhat better success.
He placed his materials, including a number of coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span> drawings, at
the disposal of Ray, the father of systematic Natural History in Great
Britain, who has acknowledged the assistance he derived from him in his
editions of Willughby's 'Ornithology' and 'Ichthyology,' especially in
the former. But Browne, it seems, found it more easy to lend than to
recover such materials; for he complains, several years afterwards, that
these drawings, of whose safe return he was assured, both by Ray and by
their mutual friend, Sir Philip Skippon, had not been sent back to
him."<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_F_6" id="Footnote_F_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_F_6"><span class="label">[F]</span></a> Dr. Robert Plot (1640-1696) was born at Sutton Barne, Kent,
in 1640; he graduated M.A. in 1664, and D.C.L. at Oxford in 1671. He was
chiefly noted as an antiquary, and was Secretary of the Royal Society
from 1682 to 1684, also the first custodian of the Ashmoleian Museum and
Professor of Chemistry at Oxford. In 1677 he published his "Natural
History of Oxfordshire," the first local work of the kind which
appeared; it was illustrated by sixteen plates. In 1686 he also
published "The Natural History of Staffordshire," and subsequently many
other books and papers. He was evidently acquainted with most of the
learned men of his time. Plot died at his family estate Sutton Barne, on
the 30th of April, 1696, and was buried at Borden in Kent. Dr. Plot was
a friend of Browne's, and his companion in a tour in England in
1693.&mdash;"Dict. Nat. Biog."</p></div>

<p>I have endeavoured to reproduce as accurately as possible the text of
the notes and letters, which, as will be seen from the example
photographed for the frontispiece of this volume, was often very
difficult to decipher. The originals of the notes and of seven of the
nine letters to Merrett, as also the two letters in <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A.</a>, are in
the Sloane Collection of MSS. in the British Museum Library; those
numbered vii. and viii., as well as two letters in <a href="#APPENDIX_D">Appendix D.</a>, which

letter to Dugdale in <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B.</a> is extracted from the "Eastern
Counties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span> Collectanea." All the MSS. in the Sloane Collection I have
transcribed myself; of those in the Bodleian Library, No. vii. is from a
photograph, the remainder were copied for me by a person recommended as
being highly reliable. I thought it best to retain all the erasures and
interlineations in order to show as much as possible what was passing in
their author's mind: in the foot-notes I have sought to acknowledge <i>in
situ</i> the valuable help I received from numerous correspondents to whom
my best thanks are due, but I owe a special debt of gratitude to
Professor Newton, at whose instigation the work was undertaken, for his
kind assistance and for the loan of scarce books which it was necessary
to consult in the interesting investigations needful to elucidate, if
possible, some of the obscure passages in the text, a task in which if
with the best intentions should I have sometimes failed, I must ask the
reader's indulgence.</p>

<p>It may be truly said of Sir Thomas Browne that a prophet hath no honour
in his own country; the writings of this remarkable man are little known
in the city of his adoption, and a recent movement to erect a monument
to his memory has hitherto met with feeble support.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_H_8" id="Footnote_H_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_H_8"><span class="label">[H]</span></a> The heading adopted by Wilkin, for which I cannot find that
he had any authority, is certainly misleading, for the brief and
fragmentary notes which follow, although of great interest, can hardly
be called "An Account of the Birds (or Fishes) found in Norfolk," as
there are many species of each inhabiting or visiting the county which
must have been well-known to Browne, but of which we find no mention.</p></div>

<p class="center">[MSS. SLOAN. 1830. FOL. 5-19. AND 31.]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The first four pages in the volume of Manuscript consist of two
inserted letters from Merrett to Browne (see <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A.</a>); these
are on ordinary letter paper 6-1/4 inches by 7 inches. The notes
commence on folio 5 and are continued to folio 19; one leaf,
containing an account of the Roller (numbered 31), is bound up
with the notes on the Fishes, &amp;c., which are numbered
consecutively with the Birds; the paper of the volume is
foolscap, 11-1/2 by 7-1/2 inches, and written, with a few
exceptions, which appear to be subsequent additions, on the
right-hand opening only. There are four folios after the Birds,
the first of which is blank; the others, numbered 20, 21, and
22, contain rough memoranda on the Birds and Fishes, the
substance of which is embodied in the other notes; the Fishes
commence on folio 23. There are many erasures, interlineations,
and substituted words which indicate hasty writing, and the
alterations are not in all cases complete, thus rendering the
sense occasionally obscure; these emendations I have thought it
best to preserve as indicating the author's line of thought. In
the foot-notes which follow I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> endeavoured to identify the
species treated of. This, notwithstanding the kind assistance of
the friends whose help I gratefully acknowledge, I may not in
all cases have successfully accomplished; the conclusions
arrived at are occasionally only conjectural, and it may be that
in some instances I have erred. Should such be the case I must
plead in excuse the difficulty arising from vagueness of
description, the frequent use of vernacular names which have
long since become obsolete (<a href="#Footnote_22_32"><i>see Note</i> 22</a>), and the imperfection
of the record. This especially applies to the Marine Animals,
and one of my correspondents rightly remarks that "the early
accounts of marine beasts are so vague, and the figures (where
referred to) so incomplete and often fanciful, that it is
difficult even to make out the family, to say nothing of genera
and species." Any assistance or correction in this respect would
be gladly received by me.]</p></div>

"Introduction," <a href="#Page_xxi">p. xxi.</a>). The opening passage was probably addressed to
the deceased correspondent who had asked his assistance, whereas his
first <a href="#merrett_1">letter to Merrett</a> seems to indicate that the offer of help to him
came spontaneously from Browne ("I take ye boldness to salute you,"
&amp;c.), and was not in response to Merrett's request.</p></div>

<p>Beside the ordinarie birds which keep constantly in the country many are

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_10" id="Footnote_2_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_10"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Browne seems to have had on the whole a fairly correct idea
with regard to the migratory movements of the birds on the Norfolk coast
where peculiar facilities exist for such observations, but of course he
could have formed no notion of the extent to which they prevail, perhaps
no species being altogether sedentary. The general line of the autumn
migration for those which spend their summer in Northern Europe is south
or south-west, returning in the spring by the reverse route; those which
visit us in spring from Western Europe, or countries lying still more to
the eastward, adopt what is known as the east to west route, and reverse
the direction in the autumn; but this latter is as nothing compared with
the vast number of immigrants by both routes in the early autumn, at
which time, especially, the movements are so exceedingly complex that it
would be impossible here to attempt to explain them, and the reader must
be referred to Mr. Eagle Clarke's digest of the Reports of the Migration
Committee of the British Association ("Report Brit. Ass. for 1876," pp.
451-477).</p></div>

<p>The great &amp; noble kind of Agle calld Aquila Gesneri<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I have not seen

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_11" id="Footnote_3_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_11"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The "Aquila" of Gesner here referred to is evidently the
Golden Eagle, which species Browne is careful to mention that he had not
met with in this county, and that the specimen he sent to Dr. Scarburgh,
more than once mentioned, was brought from Ireland. This bird has never
been recorded alive in Norfolk. Immature White-tailed Eagles, the
"Halyætus" of the text, still occur almost every autumn or winter on
this coast, but no mature example has hitherto been killed. Browne's
friend, Sir Charles Scarburgh (1616-1694), was born in London, and is
buried at Cranford, in Middlesex. He seems to have been greatly
distinguished as an anatomist and physician. He was a friend of William
Harvey, whom he succeeded as Lumleyan Lecturer at the College of
Physicians (of which he was elected a fellow in 1650). Harvey, out of
regard for his "lovinge friend" Dr. Scarburgh, bequeathed to him his
"little silver instruments of surgerie" and his velvet gown. ("Dict. of
Nat. Biog.") The Golden Eagle sent him by Browne was kept in the College
of Physicians in Warwick Lane for two years.</p></div>

Broads and Rivers of Norfolk. Browne names it correctly, but there was
much confusion with regard to this species in the minds of the old
authors. Willughby knew the bird and calls it the "Bald Buzzard," but in
describing its nesting site and eggs (probably not on his own
authority,) evidently confounds it with the Marsh Harrier, for he says
that "it builds upon the ground among reeds, and lays three or four
large white eggs of a figure exactly elliptical, lesser than hens'
eggs." <a href="#Footnote_6_15"><i>See Note</i> 6.</a></p></div>

only an extremely rare visitor to Norfolk. In 1815, it appears from Hunt
("British Ornithology"), not to have been uncommon, but the same
authority in his list of Norfolk Birds contributed to Stacey's "History"
of that County, speaks of the Kite as having in 1829 become extremely
rare. It probably ceased to nest in this County about the year 1830, or
perhaps a little later. Browne's reason for its comparative scarcity
about the City of Norwich, viz., the abundance of Ravens mentioned at <a href="#Page_27">p.
27</a> <i>infra</i>, is very interesting to us in the present day when Kites and
Ravens are almost equally rare.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_15" id="Footnote_6_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_15"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> It seems likely that Browne here refers to two species of
Harrier, the Grey Buzzard being the male of the Hen Harrier (including
of course Montagu's Harrier which was not discriminated till long after)
in its grey adult plumage, whereas the Marsh Harrier, with its light
yellow head, to which the word "bald" as then used might well be
applied, would stand for the "Bald Buzzard." The Harriers, which were
till long after the time he wrote extremely numerous, are generally
called "Buzzards" by the natives, and it will be noticed at <a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a>
<i>infra</i>, that what is doubtless intended for the Marsh Harrier is spoken
of as an enemy to the Coots; also at <a href="#Page_56">p. 56</a>, it is said that young Otters
"have been found in the Buzzards nests," a very likely circumstance with
so fierce a bird, and one of which I have an impression I have heard in
recent years. The Hen Harrier is now an extremely rare bird with us; the
Marsh Harrier still occasionally nests in the Broads, and Montagu's
Harrier now and then attempts to rear a brood, but even should the
parents succeed in escaping it is very seldom they carry their young
with them. Professor Newton has kindly favoured me with the following
additional interesting note on this bird. "The Marsh Harrier is
certainly the 'Balbushardus' of Turner (1544), which, though he says it
is bigger and longer than the ordinary <i>Buteo</i>, has a white patch on the
head and is generally of a dark brown (<i>fuscus</i>) colour, hunting the
banks of rivers, pools, and marshes, living by the capture of Ducks, and
the black birds which the English call Coots (<i>Coutas</i>). This he,
Turner, has himself very often seen, and he describes its habits
correctly; adding that it also takes Rabbits occasionally. Gesner, 1555,
quotes Turner, but refers the Bald Buzzard to the Osprey (which he
figures), and so the mistake began. Certainly Willughby's Bald Buzzard
is the Osprey, but his book was not published when Browne wrote."</p></div>

<p>Cranes<a name="FNanchor_7_16" id="FNanchor_7_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_16" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> are often seen here in hard winters especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> about the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_16" id="Footnote_7_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_16"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> In the present day the Crane is only a rare straggler to
this country generally at the seasons of its migration; that it was in
times past abundant in suitable localities there is ample evidence; that
it also bred in the fens of the Eastern Counties there is no reason to
doubt, but very little direct evidence is forthcoming, therefore every
fact bearing upon this point is of value. Had Sir Thomas Browne written
with the intention of publishing his observations he would doubtless
have told us much about this grand bird, which would have been of the
greatest interest to modern ornithologists, but even the above brief
remarks, as will be seen, are worthy of note.
</p><p>
With regard to the occurrence of the Crane in the fens of East Anglia we
have the following evidence; its fossil remains have been found in the
peat at Burwell, in Cambridgeshire, and in excavating the docks at Lynn.
Turner, in his "Avium Historia," Coloniæ, 1544, speaks of having seen
young Cranes in this country, and as he passed fifteen years at
Cambridge, it was probably in that neighbourhood that he met with them;
then again there is the Act of Parliament, passed in 1534 (25th Hen.
VIII. c. ii.), prohibiting the taking of their eggs (amongst those of
other species) under a penalty of twenty pence. All this is well known,
but being desirous to ascertain whether any reference to the Crane was
to be found in the records of the Corporation of Norwich, Mr. J. C.
Tingey, F.S.A., the custodian of the Muniment Room, at my request, most
kindly searched the accounts of the City Chamberlain between the years
1531 and 1549. He there found numerous entries of sums expended in the
purchase of cranes, swans, porpoises, &amp;c., as presents to the Dukes of
Norfolk and Suffolk and others, and amongst them, on the 6th of June,
1543, a charge for a "yong pyper crane" from Hickling, which appears
conclusive evidence of the breeding of this bird near Norwich at that
time. (See "Transactions of the N. and N. Nat. Soc.," vii., pp.
160-170.)
</p><p>
In Wilkin's Edition of the Notes the statement, "I met" with Cranes in a
dish should be, "I meet with," &amp;c., as it is in the original. The
occasion referred to was probably an entertainment given by the Mayor of
Norwich, on the Guild day in 1663, which in that year fell on the 19th
June; at this banquet Henry, Duke of Norfolk and the Hon. Henry Howard
were present, and the latter presented to the City a silver basin and
ewer of the value of £60. Can it be that even at that time young Cranes
were to be obtained? otherwise the middle of June seems a most
unseasonable time for such a dish; for in a copy of a curious old
manuscript, dated 1605, and published in the 13th Volume of
"Archæologia" (p. 315), entitled "A Breviate touching the Order and
Government of a Nobleman's house," &amp;c., there is a "Monthlie Table, for
a Diatorie" for each month in the year, and the Crane appears only in
the tables from November till March inclusive. The modern gourmet would
view with disgust some of the dishes included in this "diatorie" if set
before him&mdash;only to mention among birds, auks, stares, petterells,
puffines, didapers, and martins. The crane being "in the dish" must not
be subjected to the vulgar process of "kervyng," but in the stilted
heraldic language of the day must be "desplayed," whereas a heron must
be "dismembered" and a bittern "unjointed." The price of a crane varied
from 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i>, and a fat swan from 3<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i> The sum of
6<i>d.</i> mentioned in the le Strange Household-book, in the year 1533 (see
"Archæologia," vol. xxv., p. 529), quoted in Yarrell's "British Birds,"
iii., p. 180, was only the reward for bringing in a crane killed on the
estate. That Cranes must at times have been numerous in Norfolk in the
sixteenth century is evident, for in an account of the presents sent to
William Moore, Esq., of Loseley, on the occasion of the marriage of his
daughter, on 3rd November, 1567, Mr. Balam, "out of Marshland in
Norfolk," sent him nine cranes, nine swans, and sixteen bitterns, with a
large number of other wild-fowl. "Archæologia," vol. xxxvi., p. 36.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p></div>

<p>In hard winters elkes<a name="FNanchor_8_17" id="FNanchor_8_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_17" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a kind of wild swan are seen in no small

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_17" id="Footnote_8_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_17"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The "Elke" is an obsolete name for the Wild Swan (<i>Cygnus
musicus</i>), which occurs in the present day in the same numbers and under
precisely similar circumstances as Browne describes; but of course this
was the only species of wild swan known to him. The remarkable
recurvation of the trachea within the keel of the sternum, which also
prevails to a greater or less degree in four out of the five or six
species of Cygnus found in the Northern Hemisphere, did not escape
Browne's notice, although he was not the first to describe it, and he
rightly observes that this peculiarity is absent in the Mute Swan (<i>C.
olor</i>), but exists in a different and even more exaggerated form in the
Crane. He, however, was mistaken as to the extreme northerly range which
he assigns to this species. So marked a feature as the absence of the
"berry" on the beak of this species did not escape Browne's observation,
and he refers to it in the eighth <a href="#merrett_8">letter to Merrett</a>, who in his second
letter to Browne remarks "the difference in the elk's bill by you
signified is remarkable to distinguish it from others of its kind,"
indicating that this distinction was previously unknown to him.</p></div>

<p>A white large &amp; strong billd fowle called a Ganet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_9_18" id="FNanchor_9_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_18" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which seemes to

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_18" id="Footnote_9_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_18"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> As a rule the Gannet does not approach the shore, except to
breed, but follows the shoals of fish far out at sea. The circumstance
mentioned by Browne is by no means singular, and several such instances
of storm-driven Gannets being captured far inland are recorded. The
"Scotch Goose, <i>Anser scoticus</i>," mentioned further on (<a href="#Page_13">p. 13</a> <i>infra</i>),
is also in all probability intended for the Gannet; it is the <i>Anser
Bassanus sive Scoticus</i> of Jonston. The "Marshland" here mentioned is a
tract of country reclaimed in ancient times from the sea, lying to the
west of the town of Lynn, of some 57,000 acres in extent, and bordering
upon the estuary of the Wash.</p></div>

good description of the Great Skua (<i>Stercorarius catarrhactes</i>) under
the name of <i>Catarracta</i>, a skin of which he says was sent him by Dr.
Walter Needham, and rightly identified it with the Skua which Hoier sent
to Clusius, but his figure is evidently drawn from a skin of the Great
Black-backed Gull. Hoier, whose name so often occurs about this time in
connection with birds from the north, was a physician, living at Bergen
in Norway. The Great Skua still breeds in sadly reduced numbers on the
Shetland and Faröe Islands, but <ins title="us deleted per errata.">is</ins> rarely met with in

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_20" id="Footnote_11_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_20"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The bird here mentioned is doubtless the Great Northern
Diver, <i><ins title="Inserted per errata.">Colymbus glacialis</ins></i>. In another place Browne again refers to it as <i>Mergus maximus
Farrensis</i>, which Clusius ("Exotic.," p. 102)
calls <i>Mergus maximus <ins title="Inserted per errata.">Farrensis</ins></i>, a name used by Willughby as a synonym for his
"Greatest Speckled Diver or Loon" (p. 341). This bird is known to our
fishermen as the Herring Loon, the Red-throated and perhaps also the
Black-throated Divers being called Sprat Loons. It is a pity Browne's
"draught" is not forthcoming.</p></div>

numbers on the north-west portion of the County of Norfolk than on the

universally known as the "Dickey-bird."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_22" id="Footnote_13_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_22"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Browne here refers to the family in general terms. The
various species of Gulls in their different stages of plumage were very
puzzling to the Ornithologists of the last century, and it is often
extremely difficult to say to what individual species they refer. By
<i>Larus major</i> he would probably mean the Black-backed and Herring Gulls
which are found on the shore all the year round, most frequently in the
immature plumage, but they most abound "in herring time." By far the
commonest species at all times is Browne's <i>Larus alba</i> or Puet, the
Black-headed Gull. Large flocks of this species and <i>L. canus</i> frequent
Breydon and the tidal shores, especially the young birds of the year.
There are now two large breeding-places of the Black-headed Gull in
Norfolk, a very old-established one at Scoulton Mere, and a more recent
colony at Hoveton Broad. The former extensive gullery at Horsey,
mentioned by Browne, has long since been banished by the drainage of the
marsh they frequented, and it is probable that a small colony which bred
on Ormesby Broad some forty years ago, owed its origin to their
banishment from Horsey. They, in their turn, deserted Ormesby on the
erection of the works for supplying Yarmouth with water about the year
1855, and fixed upon Hoveton as their new home, in which place, as at
Scoulton, they are carefully preserved.
</p><p>
Professor Newton has been kind enough to furnish me with the following
note on the Terns. "<i>Larus cinereus</i> of Aldrovandus (and afterwards of
Jonston), is said to be of three kinds: one with red legs, apparently
the Black-headed Gull, and figured by Jonston, the second with yellow
legs and a slender curved black bill, the third with a pointed scarlet
bill. Both these last were most likely Terns&mdash;and all these were grey
above and white below. Gesner quotes Turner for <i>Sterna</i>, and there is
no doubt that his bird of that name was a Black Tern; but Gesner says
that it is the <i>Stirn</i> of the Frisians, and figures a white and grey
bird with a black head only (most likely a Common Tern, but possibly one
of the larger species), as Sterna, thus using the word in a more general
sense, and it may have been so used in Browne's time. I see no
impossibility in people having thought of eating Terns in those days [as
to that <a href="#Footnote_7_16"><i>see Note</i> 7</a>, p. 6 <i>ante</i>]. The Common Tern was most likely very
abundant, and we know that the Black Tern was exceedingly common in
certain reed-beds, as stated by Turner, and noisy beyond measure." The
Great and Lesser Terns still nest in one or two localities on our coast,
although as the result of great persecution in very reduced numbers. The
Black Tern, or Mire Crow, has quite ceased to do so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_23" id="Footnote_14_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_23"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Although it has been met with in Norfolk, more frequently
than perhaps in any other part of England, the Stork was never other
than a rare spring and autumn visitor to Norfolk. Turner writes of it in
1544 as unknown in England, save as a captive, and Merrett a hundred
years later says it rarely flies hither, which is equally true at the
present time. Hewittson ("Eggs of Brit. Birds," Ed. 3, ii., p. 309;
under Crane) was evidently misled by some remarks made by Evelyn, who
visited Sir Thomas Browne in Norwich in October, 1671, and says in his
diary that he saw Browne's "Collection of the eggs of all the fowl and
birds he could procure; that country, especially the promontory of
Norfolk, being frequented, as he said, by several birds which seldom or
never go further into the land&mdash;as cranes, storks, eagles, and a variety
of water-fowl." From this Hewitson infers that the Stork bred in
Norfolk, a construction which the somewhat ambiguously worded passage
will certainly not bear. I imagine collections of eggs were not very
common in Browne's time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_24" id="Footnote_15_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_24"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> This interesting record has recently been supplemented by
a much earlier record of the breeding of the "Popeler," or Shovelard, in
Norfolk. Professor Newton ("Transactions of N. and N. Nat. Soc.," vi.,
p. 158) has called attention to an ancient document bearing date A.D.
1300, instituting a commission to inquire into the harrying of the
eyries of these and other birds, &amp;c., at Cantley and other places in
Norfolk. Documents also exist, showing that in 1523 they nested at
Fulham in Middlesex, and in 1570 in West Sussex, as pointed out by Mr.
Harting in the "Zoologist" for 1877, p. 425, and 1886, p. 81, in each
case constructing their nests in trees. At what precise date this bird
ceased to breed in Norfolk and Suffolk is unknown, but Sir T. Browne's
statement that they were "shot by fowlers not for their meat, butt the
handsomenesse of the same," probably explains the circumstances which
brought about that event. The Spoonbill visits Norfolk regularly every
spring in small parties now more numerously than a few years since,
which possibly may be accounted for by the destruction of nearly all its
breeding-places in Holland, and it is possible that with due
encouragement it might again be induced to breed in some of the
localities in the Broads still suitable for the purpose.</p></div>

of Fritton Lake for many years after Sir T. Browne's time. A manuscript
note in a copy of Berkenhout's "Natural History of Great Britain and
Ireland," published in 1769, is descriptive of a Cormorant killed at
Belton Decoy (near the same lake) on the 11th September, 1775, and also
states that "a vast number of these birds, even to some thousands, roost
every night upon the trees," being in the neighbourhood of the decoy
they are never shot, and "build their nests upon the top of these
trees." According to Mr. Lubbock ("Fauna of Norf.," Ed. 2, p. 174), "in
1825 there were many nests at Herringfleet, also on Fritton Lake, and in
1827 not one." We may therefore assume that they ceased to nest at
Herringfleet in 1825 or 1826. It will be noticed that Browne made free
use of young Cormorants in his experiments as to the properties of
certain drugs (cf. Wilkin, iv., p. 452), which would seem to indicate
that he could obtain a plentiful supply of these birds. When the
Cormorants ceased to breed at Reedham is unknown. They are not
unfrequently seen now, generally in spring and autumn. The Rock
Cormorant was possibly the Crested Cormorant or Shag.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p></div>

Shearwater ("Ornithology," p. 334) was from a drawing sent him by Sir T.
Browne, who describes the bird, as above, under the accepted name of
Shearwater, and Willughby's excellent figure on plate lxvii. (which
plate I believe is not to be found in some copies of the "Ornithology,"
and to which there is no reference in the text) has all the appearance
of having been drawn from life. The drawing here referred to is
mentioned by Ray in his "Collection of English <ins title="Birds in original">words</ins> not generally
known," as having been received, with others, from the "learned and
deservedly famous Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich." George Edwards
("Gleanings of Nat. Hist.," vii., p. 315), prior to 1764. says that he
went to the British Museum and examined Browne's "old draught," but I
could not find it among any of the papers I examined. In Browne's fourth
<a href="#merrett_4">letter to Merrett</a>, by an error in the transcription, he is made by
Wilkin to say that he kept twenty of these birds alive for five weeks;

name for the Sheld-drake, as used by Turner in 1544, and derived from
the Dutch Berg-eende, German Bergente ("Dict. Birds," p. 835). Browne's
statement that this bird formerly bred about Northwold, or as it is even
now occasionally called by the natives, "Norrold," some twenty miles
from the sea; or, as he says, in the fourth <a href="#merrett_4">letter to Merrett</a>,
"abounding in vast and spatious commons," is very interesting, although
not a solitary instance, for I am informed that this bird breeds in the
present day on the Gull Lake, Twig Moor, in Lincolnshire; but that it
should have chosen such a nesting site is not more surprising than the
fact of the Ring Plover, quite as strictly a marine species, frequenting
the extensive sandy warrens about Thetford and Brandon, near the <ins title="center in original">south-west border</ins>
of the county, for the same purpose, as they still continue to do. But
for Browne's mention of the circumstance we should not have been aware
of this singular departure from the normal nesting habits of the
Sheld-duck, as no tradition I believe exists on the subject, and at
present it only nests in the sand-hills in some parts of the coast of
N.W. Norfolk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p></div>

the following are a few examples: Adult Smew, White Nun; female or

strange that the abundance of Teal should in any way be attributed to
the number of Decoys, but such was really the case, the quiet and
shelter afforded by these extensive preserves being very favourable to
the increase of all the members of the Duck family, especially to those
breeding in their immediate neighbourhood. In the returns of the old
Decoys, Teal figured largely; in the present day they form a very much

Kites and little from Moor Buzzards; it may be that it is in consequence
of this that they have discontinued the practice of twining the rushes
and reeds above their nests in the manner mentioned above as being an
unnecessary precaution. I have, however, in some cases noticed some
approach to this practice. The Coot, although fairly numerous on the
Broads, appears to be far less so than formerly. Lubbock, in his "Fauna
of Norfolk," says on asking a Broadman how many Coots there were on
Hickling Broad, his reply was, "About an acre and a half," referring to
their practice of swimming evenly at regular distances from each other
without huddling together in dense masses, like wild-fowl.
</p><p>
I am indebted to Professor Newton for the following additional note on
the Coot. He says "Turner, and after him Gesner, was puzzled as to what
was the <i>Fulica</i> of classical writers (Virgil and others), and thought
it to be some kind of Gull; but the <i>Fulica</i> of later authors was
certainly the Coot, as shown by Gesner's figure."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_35" id="Footnote_25_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_35"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> There is every reason to believe that a species of
Pelican, probably from its size <i>P. crispus</i>, was formerly an inhabitant
of the East Anglian Fens; its bones have been found in the peat on three
occasions, one of these being the bone of a bird so young as to show
that it must have been bred in the locality, and therefore that the
species was a true native and not a casual visitant. Bones of a species
of Pelican have also been found in the remains of lake-dwellings at
Glastonbury, in Somersetshire.
</p><p>
With regard to the species of the bird recorded by Browne and its
origin, he is careful to point out that a Pelican had about that time
escaped from the King's collection in St. James' Park, and to surmise
that it might be the same bird; from what follows this seems probable,
but as <i>P. onocrotalus</i> is believed to stray occasionally into the
northern parts of Germany and France ("Dict. of Birds," p. 702) the
occurrence of that species on the East Coast of Britain, where, even at
present, it would find a state of things in every way suited to its
requirements (guns excepted), would not be very extraordinary. Browne's
Pelican was killed in May, 1663, and although Dr. Edward Browne visited
St. James' Park in February, 1664, and saw "many strange creatures,"
including the Stork with the wooden leg (mentioned by Evelyn), he says
nothing of the Pelicans, still it may be that it was from him that his
father heard of the escape. Evelyn, in his Diary, mentioned that he
visited St. James' Park on February 9th, 1665, and speaks of only one
Pelican, which he states was brought from Astrakan by the Russian
Ambassador as a present to the King; Willughby says distinctly that the
Emperor of Russia sent the King two Pelicans, and further, that he took
the description in his "Ornithology" from a bird in the Royal Aviary,
St. James' Park, near Westminster; it seems therefore highly probable
that Browne's bird was one of these which had escaped from confinement.
But a rather curious circumstance arises out of this, the bird described
by Willughby does not appear to be <i>P. onocrotalus</i>, but a similar
species, <i>P. roseus</i>, found chiefly in Indio-China and westward to
South-eastern Europe, but occurring as far west as the River Volga
("Cat. of Birds," B. M., xxvi., p. 466). In this Mr. Ogilvie Grant, the
author of that section of the Catalogue, whom I consulted, agrees with
me, and the locality whence the birds were derived, mentioned by
Willughby, renders not unlikely. Onocrotalus in Browne's time was a
general term for "the Pelican," and he probably knew but one species and
one individual, the escaped bird from Charles II.'s Aviary. Browne's
very miscellaneous collection was destroyed by the authorities at the
time of the plague (see ninth <a href="#merrett_9">letter to Merrett</a>), and probably the
remains of this Pelican perished with the rest.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_36" id="Footnote_26_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_36"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> This is one of the birds once common enough in Norfolk,
which in the present day is only a winter and spring migrant. The last
eggs of the Bittern were taken in this county on 30th of March, 1868;
the last "boom" of a resident was heard in May, 1886, in the August of
which year a young female was killed at Reedham with down still adhering
to its feathers; this was probably the last Norfolk-bred Bittern. In the
"Vulgar Errors," book 3, chapter xxvii., section 4, is a discourse on
the "mugient noise" of the Bittern and the mode of its production, and
in a foot-note in the same place is a curious anecdote illustrating the
difficulty of detecting a wounded Bittern, even when marked down in
short, recently mown grass and flags. The spring cry of the Bittern is
mentioned by Robert Marsham in his unpublished journal nineteen times,
between the years 1739 and 1775, as first heard at Stratton Strawless,
generally between the 15th of March and the 15th of April; and it was on
the 14th of the latter month that Benjamin Stillingfleet records it in
the "Calendar of Flora" as heard in the same locality in 1755. He does
not describe the note, but uses the words "makes a noise." Marsham,
however, on one occasion, in 1750, a very early year, records it on the
20th of February. As a once familiar sound, but one which will probably
never again be heard here under purely normal conditions, these dates
seem worthy of recording.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_37" id="Footnote_27_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_37"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The last of the Norfolk and therefore certainly the last
of the British-bred Bustards, was killed in May, 1838; those which have
since occurred in this country were Continental immigrants. An
exhaustive history of the extinction of this bird will be found in
Stevenson's "Birds of Norfolk," vols. 2 and 3. The Bustard, although
found in some numbers, associated in small flocks or "droves" in the few
localities which it frequented in Great Britain, was probably never a
very numerous species. The following extract from one of Browne's
letters to his son Edward, dated April 30th, and written probably in
1681, shows that he was on the verge of discovering an anatomical
peculiarity in this family of birds, which in after years gave rise to
much controversy. He says, "yesterday I had a cock Bustard sent me from
beyond Thetford. I never did see such a vast thick neck: the crop was
pulled out, butt as [a] turkey hath an odde large substance without, so
hath this within the inside of the skinne, and the strongest and largest
neckbone of any bird in England. This I tell you, that if you meet with
one you may further observe it." The presence of a gular pouch in the
Bustard was first demonstrated by James Douglas, a Scotch Physician, in
1740, and it appears to be fully developed only in the adult male bird,
and at the breeding season. Hence, although it has undoubtedly been
found on several occasions, the frequent unsuccessful searches for it
under unfavourable conditions led to much scepticism as to its
existence. The use of this singular appendage is still a moot point, but
it seems probable that it has to do with "voice production," and assists
in the remarkable "showing off" exhibited by the male bird in the
breeding season. Pennant, in his "British Zoology," 1768, i., p. 215,
gives a sentimental account of its use, and an exaggerated estimate of
its proportions. In the Tables of Dietary referred to at <a href="#Footnote_7_16">p. 6 (note)</a>
<i>ante</i>, the Bustard is mentioned as in season from October to May.</p></div>

but in decreased numbers. The Sea Dotterel which Wilkin supposes to be
the Ring Plover, is undoubtedly the Turnstone. Willughby says, "Our
honoured Friend, Sir Thomas Browne, of Norwich, sent us the picture of
this bird by the title of the Sea Dotterel." This is also mentioned in
the <a href="#merrett_5">fifth letter to Merrett</a>. See "Birds of Norfolk," ii., p. 82, for an

Willughby, says, "Our Bolognese Fowlers do unanimously affirm, that
there are found a greater and a lesser sort of Cuckows; and besides,
that the greater are of two kinds, which are distinguished one from the
other by the only difference of colour: but the lesser differ from the
greater in nothing else but magnitude." Perhaps it was Browne's latent
respect for antiquity which led him to mention the tradition.</p></div>

preceding writers, in a general sense for all birds commonly called
"Woodpeckers," and does not imply that the Great Black Woodpecker
(<i>Picus niger maximus</i>, of Ray's Synopsis), to which species the name
was restricted by Linnæus, is found here, and Browne goes on to mention
the three British Woodpeckers, the Green, the Red, by which the Great
Spotted Woodpecker is intended, and the Leucomelanus, or Lesser-spotted
Woodpecker. He also includes the Nuthatch, which was at that time (as
well as the Wryneck) called a "Woodpecker." In this passage Browne, in
making a correction, does not seem to have proceeded far enough, the
word which Wilkin has rendered "dun-coloured," is certainly "dunne
calld" in the MS.; but there are two alterations in the passage, and
there is little doubt that he intended to write "dunne cull'd" (or
coloured), which would make it read as Wilkin has printed it. The use of
the word "nerve," for tendon or ligament, was in accordance with the
phraseology of the time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p></div>

with the Hobby. It may be that the Hobby having become comparatively
scarce, it was necessary to find another travelling companion for this
bird, and that the Cuckoo was chosen as the most suitable. Old Norfolk
names are Emmet-eater, and in one old book it is called Turkey-bird in a

writer's experience. When the full complement of four eggs is laid, they
are arranged with their pointed ends towards the centre of the nest,
which is a slight hollow in the soil. The concavity of the nest
therefore, as well as the disproportionate size of the larger end, gives
the eggs somewhat the appearance of being placed in the position
referred to, but the small end of the egg is always visible, Sir Thomas
Browne does not seem to have been aware of the remarkable fact of this
essentially marine bird habitually nesting on the sandy warrens about
Thetford in the south-west of Norfolk, far from the sea, which it still
does, though in reduced numbers, and is there known as the Stone-hatch,
from its habit of paving its nest with small stones.</p></div>

the locality named by Browne, and is found in several other parts of the
county. Willughby says, "The learned and famous Sir Thomas Brown,
Physician in Norwich," informed him to the same effect, and repeats that
its note (one of the most charming sounds uttered on the wild trackless
heath on a summer's night) resembles that of the Green (<i>i.e.</i>, Golden)
Plover, but in the ear of the writer it is even more musical. In the
third <a href="#merrett_3">letter to Merrett</a>, Browne says that he has kept the Stone Curlew
(not "four Curlews," as Wilkin has it,) in large cages.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_49" id="Footnote_38_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_49"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> The Avoset is another bird which formerly frequented the
marshy districts of Norfolk at the breeding time, but which has now been
lost to us except as a very rare passing migrant in the spring. It
probably ceased to breed in this county in or about the year 1818, and
is said to have been exterminated in consequence of the demand for its
feathers for the purpose of dressing artificial flies. It was called
"Shoeing-horn," from the peculiar form of its beak, which, however,
rather resembles the bent awl used by shoemakers. Girdlestone, who knew
the bird well in its breeding haunts at Salthouse and Horsey, called it
"Shoe-awl," a much more appropriate name. In his third letter to
Merrett, Browne again mentions this bird, and applies to it the name of
"Barker" (which he had crossed out in the above note), remarking that it
was so called from its barking note. Jonston figures this bird twice;
once in Tab. 48 under the name of <i>Avosetta Italor.</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the
Avosetta of the Italians, and again in Tab. 54 under the second name
<i>Avoselta species</i>, an obvious error.</p></div>

Yarwhelp is the name by which the Black-tailed Godwit, a species which
formerly nested in abundance in the marshes about Horsey and some
adjacent localities in the Broads, was known. It virtually ceased to
nest here sometime between the years 1829 and 1835, but perhaps an
instance or two may have occurred rather later. It was also known as the
"Shrieker." Browne again refers to this bird in the fourth <a href="#merrett_4">letter to
Merrett</a>, where he calls it "barker" (a name which he had no doubt
erroneously previously applied to the Avoset), or "Latrator, a
marshbird, about the bigness of a Godwitt," and once again under the
name of "Yare-whelp, or barker," in his <a href="#merrett_5">fifth letter</a>; it may be that the
name "barker" was applied indiscriminately to either species. As Lubbock
names this bird as one of the "five species in particular" which "used
formerly to swarm in our marshes" ("Fauna of Norfolk"), one would have
thought Browne would have been better acquainted with it than seems to
have been the case from the hesitating way in which he uses the
vernacular name.</p></div>

Least Butcher Bird. Browne certainly sent a drawing of this bird to Ray,
who in his "Collection of English words not generally used" (1674), as
pointed out by Mr. Gurney, mentions it as a "little Bird of a tawny
colour on the back, and a blew head, yellow bill, black legs, shot in an
Osiar yard, called by Sr. Tho. for distinction sake silerella," the
drawing of which he acknowledges he had received. Pennant, 1768 ("Brit.
Zool.," i., p. 165), follows Edwards ("Nat. Hist. of Birds," &amp;c., 1745),
who classes it with the Laniidæ, and it was not till long after, and as
the result of much discussion, that it was finally established as the
only representative of a new genus under the name of <i>Panurus
biarmicus</i>. The local name is Reed Pheasant, but Browne's name of
Silerella seems an exceedingly appropriate one.</p></div>

remarkable bird, and mentions it again in his <a href="#merrett_2">second</a> and <a href="#merrett_3">third letters

conceives it to be a kind of Accipiter, <i>muscarius</i>, or

the time. Although he used the name Caprimulgus, it will be observed
that he does not mention the "vulgar error" which led to its being so
called. Merrett includes this species in the <i>Pinax</i> under the name of
"Caprimulgus, or the Goat-sucker," but in a letter to Browne tells him
he knows no Hawk called a Dorhawk.</p></div>

The Raven (<i>C. corax</i>) is now a very rare visitor to Norfolk; it is
probable that it last nested in this county in the year 1859. The
Jackdaw, or Caddow, is common enough, but the Chough (<i>Pyrrhocorax

introduced into the Eastern Counties at Sudbourne and Rendlesham, in
East Suffolk, in or about the year 1770, by both the Marquis of Hertford
and Lord Rendlesham. How quickly they established themselves may be
judged from the fact that in the season of 1806-7 of 1,927 Partridges
killed at Rendlesham 112 were Red legs, but they do not seem to have
spread very far. A second introduction, this time into West Suffolk,
much nearer to the Norfolk border, at and about Culford, was effected in
the year 1823, and from this centre they rapidly spread into Norfolk, in
which county also others were imported by the resident proprietors.</p></div>

(<a href="#Page_15">p. 15</a> <i>ante</i>) as "a kind of <i>Ralla aquatica</i>." This bird is a summer
visitor, by no means common and very uncertain in its numbers. The same
applies to the Quail, which appears to be less frequent than formerly,
no doubt from the great destruction on the Mediterranean coast in spring
of the birds migrating to England. In the summer and autumn of 1870 we
had an unusual influx of these latter birds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_59" id="Footnote_48_59"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_59"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> In his fifth <a href="#merrett_5">letter to Merrett</a> Browne says, "I confess for
such little birds I am much unsatisfied on the names given to many by
countrymen and uncertain what to give them myself." This is painfully
apparent in the cases of the two little birds here referred to as the
"Whinne-bird" and the "Chipper." From the description of the former,
"marked with fine yellow spots and lesser than a Wren," also with a
"shining yellow spot on the back of the head," it seems likely that the
Gold-crested Wren is intended. The Chipper, he says, "comes in the
spring and feeds upon the first buddings of birches and other early
trees;" he also calls it "<i>Betulæ carptor</i>," and says that he sends a
drawing to Merrett; a third mention is as follows: "That which I called
a <i>Betulæ carptor</i>, and should rather have called it <i>Alni carptor</i> . .
. it feeds upon alder buds, nucaments, or seeds, which grow plentifully
here; they fly in little flocks." I can only suggest that this bird may
be the Siskin, which fairly answers the description. It visits us in
small flocks on its way north very early in the year, feeding upon the
seeds of the alder, birch, and larch trees. One would however have
thought that the Siskin would have been well known to Browne, as it
evidently was to Turner, Willughby, and Ray. Merrett mentions it under
Turner's name of "Luteola."</p></div>

occurrence of the Roller in Britain, to which country it is a rare
wanderer. Although it had long been known on the Continent, its identity
seems to have puzzled Browne, and he imagines (as did others, both
before and after him,) it to be some kind of Jay; later, in his second
<a href="#merrett_2">letter to Merrett</a> (January, 1668), he says that it answers to the
description of <i>Garrulus argentoratensis</i> (the name given by Aldrovandus
to whom it was known), and calls it "the Parrot-jay." This is five years
after the original note was made, and we find that the words <i>Garrulus
argentoratensis</i>, written by the same hand but with a different pen and
ink, have been added subsequently, doubtless as the result of further
information. In another letter he mentions having sent the bird to
Merrett, but adds, "If you have it before I should bee content to have
it againe otherwise you may please keep it."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_62" id="Footnote_50_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_62"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> This estimate of the number of species of birds and fishes
existing is amusing in the light of the present knowledge of the
subject. Of course any such estimate can only be approximate, and open
to constant emendation; but according to a statement in the "Zoological
Record" of 1896, it was believed that there were something like 386,000
described species: 2,500 of which are mammals, 12,500 birds, 4,400
reptilia and batrachia, 12,000 fishes, 50,000 mollusca, 20,000
crustacea, and 250,000 insecta; the smaller divisions I have omitted.
And whereas only about 10,000 species of plants were known to Linnæus,
Professor Vines in his address to the Botanical section at the Bradford
meeting of the British Association, 1900, states that the approximate
number of recognised plants at present existing is 175,596; but this is
far short of the total of existing species. Professor Saccardo states
that there are 250,000 fungi alone, and that the number of existing
species in other groups would bring the total up to over 400,000.</p></div>

<p>[<i>Fol. 23.</i>] Of fishes sometimes the larger sort are taken or come
ashoar. A spermaceti whale<a name="FNanchor_51_63" id="FNanchor_51_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_63" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of 62 foote long neere Welles. another of
the same kind 20 yeares before at Hunstanton. &amp; not farre of 8 or nine
came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> ashoare &amp; 2 had yong ones after they were forsaken by ye water.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_63" id="Footnote_51_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_63"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> In the muniment room at Hunstanton Hall there exists a
book of MSS. notes relating to their estates, kept by Sir Hamon and Sir
Nicholas le Strange, between the years 1612 and 1723. From this book Mr.
Hamon le Strange has been good enough to send me an extract containing
the full particulars of the stranding and disposal of a Sperm Whale 57
feet long, which came ashore on their Manor of Holme, on the 6th
December, 1626, the skull of which is still in the courtyard at
Hunstanton Hall.
</p><p>
Browne had not come to reside in Norwich at that time, and the chapter
on the Spermaceti Whale in his <i>Pseudodoxia Epidemica</i>, was inspired by
a subsequent occurrence of the same kind, for, as appears from the above
note, a larger individual, 62 feet long, came ashore at Wells 20 years
later, which he says led him to further inquiry. This would indicate
about the year 1646 as the date of the latter occurrence, whereas in his
third <a href="#merrett_3">letter to Merrett</a>, written in 1668, he states that it happened
"about 12 years ago," or in 1656. There is probably an error in one of
these dates.
</p><p>
Another example seems to have been found at Yarmouth about the year
1652, for we find Browne writing in that year for particulars of its
"cutting up." (See Appendix E.)
</p><p>
In the postscript to a letter also in the muniment room at Hunstanton,
dated June 11th, 1653, written to Sir Hamon le Strange, who had been
consulting him professionally, Browne says: "I pray you at your leisure
doe mee the honor to informe mee how long agoe the Spermaceti Whale was
cast upon your shoare &amp; whether you had any spermm with in any other
part butt the head." It will be noticed that in both the letters
referred to he is anxious to ascertain in what part of the body the
"sperm" was situated, doubtless for the purpose of confuting the "vulgar
conceit" as to the origin of the "sperm" referred to in the second
paragraph of his treatise in the <i>Pseudodoxia</i>. His investigations also
probably first led to a certain knowledge as to the nature of the food
of this animal.
</p><p>
These, however, although the first to be recorded in this county, were
not the first or only occurrences of the kind, for there is in the
parish church of Great Yarmouth the base of the skull of a Sperm Whale,
used as a chair, for the painting of which a charge of five shillings
appears in the churchwardens' accounts for the year 1606; many such
events in European waters are to be found recorded.
</p><p>
But the most interesting circumstance with regard to these whales is the
statement that "two had yong ones after they were forsaken by the
water." This event renders it highly improbable that they were Sperm
Whales, for the stragglers of that species which have been met with in
our waters, and indeed in the northern seas generally, have been almost
invariably solitary males, or, in one or two instances "schools" of
young males. In the only instance in which both sexes were found, the
school was composed I believe of immature individuals. (<i>Vide</i> J.
Anderson, "Nachrichten von Island, Grönland, und der Strasse Davis,"
Frantfurt (1747), p. 248.) Moreover, this view is confirmed by a letter
which will be found in <a href="#APPENDIX_B">Appendix B.</a>, where the following passage
occurs:&mdash;"And not only whales, but grampusses have been taken in this
Estuarie &hellip; and about twenty years ago four were run ashore near
Hunstanton, and two had young ones after they had come to land." A
so-called Grampus which came ashore on the 21st July, 1700, was from a
description and drawing in the le Strange MS. above quoted, a male
<i>Hyperoodon rostratus</i>, apparently nearly adult.
</p><p>
The Grampus (<i>Orca gladiator</i>) (mentioned in the next paragraph) is
frequently met with in the British seas, and has repeatedly occurred on
the Norfolk coast. Some early occurrences are on record, for instance in
Mackerell's "History of Lynn," twelve are said to have come ashore near
that town in 1636, and another in 1680. Two very juvenile examples were
taken off Yarmouth in November 1894.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_64" id="Footnote_52_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_64"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> There can be no doubt <ins title="hat in original">that</ins> the Common Dolphin (<i>Delphinus
delphis</i>) is here referred to, and indeed this species might reasonably
be expected to be met with on our coast, as its range extends at least
as far to the north as the Scandinavian waters, but so far as the writer
is aware Browne's is the only record of its having been met with in
Norfolk. The White-beaked Dolphin (<i>D. albirostris</i>) is not unfrequent,
but it is clear that Browne does not refer to that species.
</p><p>
In the "Vulgar Errors," Browne devotes a whole chapter (chapter ii. of
the fifth book) to a learned treatise on the "Picture of Dolphins," and
in one of the letters to his son Edward (Sloane MSS., 1847), dated June
14th [1676?], he writes feelingly as an anatomist, evidently fearing
that a specimen then available might be wasted, instead of being
reserved for scientific purposes; for, says he, "if the dolphin were to
be showed for money in Norwich, little would bee got; if they showed it
in London they are like to take out the viscera, and salt the fish, and
then the dissection will be unconsiderable." He then refers to the
dolphin "opened when the King was here," and describes its anatomical
peculiarities, adding that Dame Browne cooked the flesh "so as to make
an excellent savory dish of it," and that "collars" thereof (steaks cut
transversely) being sent to the King, who was then at Newmarket, for his
table, they "were well liked of." It is evident therefore that he was
present at the dissection of two of these animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p></div>

Common Seals inhabiting the sand-banks of the Wash between the Norfolk
and Lincolnshire coasts, and they are frequently captured by the
fishermen; nor has the habit of straying into fresh-water deserted them,
for in recent years they have been taken in the River Ouse at
Bluntisham, forty miles from the sea. Three other species of Seal have
been taken on the Norfolk coast, viz., <i>Phoca hispida</i>, <i>P. barbata</i>,
and <i>Halich&oelig;rus gryphus</i>.</p></div>

<p>I haue also obserued a scolopendra cetacea<a name="FNanchor_54_66" id="FNanchor_54_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_66" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> of about ten foot long
answering to the figure in Rondeletius wch the mariners told me was
taken in these seas.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_66" id="Footnote_54_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_66"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> A Scolopendra, ten feet long, is at first rather
startling, but on referring to Rondeletius's <i>Libri de piscibus Marinis</i>
(lib. xvi. p. 488), I find that under the name "Scolopendra" he includes
at least three distinct forms&mdash;i., <i>S. terrestris</i>, a centipede; ii.,
<i>S. marina</i>, certain species of <ins title="Neridiform in original.">Nereidiform</ins> polychaet worms; iii.,
<i>Scolopendra cetacea</i>, regarded as a Cetacean and figured with a
Cetacean blow-hole. With regard to this remarkable figure my friend, Dr.
S. F. Harmer, has favoured me with the following note:&mdash;"In the account
given Rondeletius is evidently writing from report; the figure is also
no doubt borrowed, and may have been 'improved' when redrawn; it seems
to me that it is based upon some kind of Tunny, although he figures a
Tunny earlier in the book (lib. viii. p. 249). The idea of the lateral
appendages might have been derived from the dorsal and ventral finlets
of a Tunny; but the first four finlets on each side are imaginary
structures, and in a wrong position. I can offer no opinion with regard
to the nasal appendages." Jonston (<i>De piscibus</i>, p. 156, Tab. xliv.)
also gives a similar figure of <i>Scolopendra</i> <i>Cetacea</i>, which appears to
be a further modification of Rondeletius's figure; here it has teeth,
shown like those of the Sperm Whale, and an extra dorsal-fin is added;
the number of lateral appendages is the same, and a column of water
proceeding from the blow-hole is falling gracefully forward. It is
worthy of notice that Rondeletius also figures the Saw-fish [Pristis]
with a blow-hole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_67" id="Footnote_55_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_67"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> In the "Transactions of the Linnean Society," ii., p. 273,
is an essay by Latham "On the various species of Sawfish," but he does
not mention any British locality. So far as I am aware Browne's is the
only record of the occurrence of this southern species in British
waters, with the exception of a note in Fleming's "British Animals," p.
164, where it is stated on the authority of the late Dr. Walker's MS.
"Adversaria" for 1769, that <i>Pristis <ins title="antiquoram in original.">antiquorum</ins></i> is "found sometimes in
Loch Long," but Fleming adds that he has met with no other proof of its
ever having visited the British shores. Browne mentions in his eighth
<a href="#merrett_8">letter to Merrett</a> that he sends him a "figure in little" of a <i>Pristis</i>
which he received of a Yarmouth seaman, and is so precise in his
statement that his fish was <i>Pristis serra</i> (the <i>Pristis antiquorum</i> of
Cuvier), that his record cannot be disregarded. He specially guards
against its being mistaken for the Sword-fish (<i>Xiphias gladius</i>), which
has been taken on several occasions in our waters, and of which he gives
some interesting particulars.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_68" id="Footnote_56_68"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_68"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> Various species of Dog-fish are frequent off the Norfolk
coast as elsewhere. The name "Sweet William" is applied to the larger
fish of this kind, especially to the Tope; this appears also to have
been the case in Pennant's time, for alluding to this vernacular name he
supposes it was applied in ironical allusion to the offensive smell of
their flesh and skin. They are objects of great aversion among the
fishermen, owing to the disturbance they create among the shoals of
fish, and the damage they do to both nets and the enclosed fish.
Scarcely a season passes but one or more specimens of Browne's <i>Canis
carcharias</i>, or, as modern Ichthyologists call it, <i>Lamna cornubica</i>,
the Porbeagle, being entangled in the drift nets and landed with the
herrings. One lies on the fish-wharf at Lowestoft as I write this note
on the 19th of October, 1900, measuring 7 feet 10 inches in length.
Jonston's figure referred to by Browne is evidently intended for this
species, but he makes a slight error in the reference to the <i>Historia
Naturalis (De Piscibus et Cetis)</i>; it occurs in book v., and the figure
is fig. 6 on Tab. vi., and it is marked <i>Canis carcharias alius</i> (not
alter).</p></div>

that Dr. Parnell in his excellent essay on "The Fishes of the District
of the Forth," describes the Sharp-nosed Sturgeon as a distinct species
under the name of <i>Acipenser sturio</i>, and the broad-nosed form he calls

Saury-pike (<i>Scombresox saurus</i>) of modern authors. <i>Acus major</i> is the
Gar-fish or Greenback (<i>Belone vulgaris</i>); this is the <i>Acus primus</i> of
Rondeletius, Dr. Harmer has been good enough to send me the following
note on Rondeletius's figures:&mdash;"<i>De Acus secunda specie</i>" (lib. viii.
p. 229). "Two species are figured; the upper figure appears to represent
<i>Siphonostoma typhle</i>, and the lower one <i>S. acus</i>. Günther ('Brit. Mus.
Cat.,' viii. p. 157) gives a reference to Rondeletius in his synonyms of
<i>S. acer</i> without indicating that the latter figures two species. Under
<i>S. typhle</i> (p. 154) he gives the synonym <i>Syngnathus rondeletii</i>, De la
Roche. A reference to Delaroche ('Ann. Mus. Hist. Nat., Paris,' xiii,
1809 p. 324, Pl. xxi. fig. 5) shows that <i>S. rondeletii</i> is identified
with the first figure on p. 229 of Rondeletius; and it may thus be
concluded that Günther agrees with this conclusion. It seems therefore
probable that Browne's Acus of Aristotle refers to <i>S. typhle</i>."</p></div>

they are of a very large size," is written on the left-hand side of the

to think from the great size of the fish here recorded (3 ft. 9 in.),
that it may have been a species of Tunny, or even a Bonito, both of
which have been taken on the Norfolk coast. Seventeen inches is a large

again in the sixth <a href="#merrett_6">letter to Merrett</a>, is not the true Bleak (<i>Alburnus

of Clupeoid was thus known, for I find it stated in a MS. note in a copy
of Berkenhout's "Outlines of the Natural History of Great Britain,"
(1769), in the possession of Mr. T. E. Gunn, that the Bleak and the
Sprat are often caught together in the sea at Aldeburgh (Suffolk) in
November, and the writer of the note adds, "the Bleak is larger than the
Sprat, its eyes are larger, and the upper part of its belly serrated." I
think from this description and from Browne's remarks, that the young of
a species of Shad must have been mistaken for the Bleak, which although
found low down in our rivers almost to where the salt tide mingles with
the fresh, does not I believe enter the salt water.</p></div>

"Scallops of the lesser sort" are probably <i>Pecten opercularius</i> and <i>P.

the staple of a considerable industry at Sheringham; the lesser, or
Dog-Whelk, <i>Nassa reticulata</i>, as well as <i>Purpura lapillus</i> and several
sorts of Trochus, are commonly met with. The genus Nerita was a very
comprehensive one in Browne's time, and included many species of
Littorina, of which the well-known Periwinkle, <i>L. <ins title="litoria in original.">littorea</ins></i>, is the most
numerous here. No true Nerita is now recognised as British, although in
the warmer seas the genus is a very numerous one. The most common
Tellina here is <i>T. tenuis</i>, <i>Lepades patellæ</i> are of course the common
Limpet (<i>Patella vulgata</i>), and of the Solen, or Razor Shell, which Gwyn
Jeffreys says in the time of Aldrovandus was called by the Venetians
"cappa longa," we have two species found on the sandy portions of the
coast. Here some confusion exists in the MS., after the words, "the
shell thereof dentalia," the note ends abruptly, and is followed by an
interpolation which seems quite irrelevant, as Dentalia have surely
never been called "Pin-patches" (the vernacular name for <i>Littorina
<ins title="litoria in original.">littorea</ins></i>), nor is it probable that, like that common univalve, they were
ever taken out of their shells with a pin or needle. <i>Dentalia</i> are
mentioned on two other occasions as of doubtful occurrence and
<i>Dentalium entalis</i> has slight claim to be a native of Norfolk; the only
recorded specimen I know of was picked up in 1890 by Mr. Mayfield, from
the drift on the beach between Wells and Holkham.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_90_105" id="Footnote_90_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_105"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> Mr. E. T. Browne, of the Zoological Laboratory of
University College, London, has kindly furnished me with the following
notes on this subject: "Jonston (1657) gives figures of Anemones and
large <i>Medusae</i> under the name of <i>Urtica</i>. On Tab. xviii. he figures
Anemones and other beasts, but not <i>medusae</i>. The <i>medusae</i> are on the
next Tab. (xix.). <i>Urtica marina</i> includes both Anemones and certain
Scyphomedusae (not <i>Pulmo</i>). Under 'some &hellip; called Squalders of a
burning and stinging quality,' I think Browne must refer to our common
stinging Scyphomedusae belonging to the genus <i>Chrysaora</i> or <i>Cyanaea</i>,
of which there are three species.
</p><p>
"The vague description of what he calls 'sea buttons' [see below, also
<a href="#merrett_2">second letter to Merrett</a>] would suit either a Medusa or a Ctenophore.
The additional note, 'two small holes in the ends,' rather upsets
matters, but I think he must refer to some sort of jelly-fish, probably
damaged, which is usually the case when cast up on the shore. If the
buttons worn in those days were like filbert-nuts or eggs, I am inclined
to think that the reference must be to a Ctenophore, genus
<i>Pleurobrachia</i>, but if flat, then to one of the <i>Hydromedusae</i>. It
would be safe to say, 'probably a kind of jelly-fish,' which is about as
vague as the reference." See also Dr. Reuben Robinson's description of
"Squalders" in a letter to Browne (Wilkin i., pp. 422-424). It seems
probable that the gelatinous masses referred to in the early part of
this letter, which Dr. Robinson says were ascribed by Dr. Charleton to
"the nocturnall pollution of some plethorick or wanton starr: or rather
excrement blowne from the nosthrills of a rheumatick planett," were the
remains of the undeveloped spawn of frogs, the bodies of which had been
eaten by rats, crows, or herons, and <ins title="which added per errata.">which</ins> had become swollen by exposure to
moisture.</p></div>

<p>[The next paragraph on folio 33 <i>verso</i> is evidently added
subsequently.]</p>

<p>Another elegant sort that is often found cast up by shoare in great
numbers about ye bignesse of a button cleere &amp; welted &amp; may bee called
fibula marina crystallina.</p>

<p>hirudines marini or sea Leaches.<a name="FNanchor_91_106" id="FNanchor_91_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_106" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_91_106" id="Footnote_91_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_106"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> It is difficult to determine the species of marine
Annelids referred to by Browne; the Sea Leech is probably <i>Pontobdella
lævis</i>. The "large wormes" digged for bait, mentioned more than once,
are Lug-worms, <i>Arenicola piscatorum</i>; the <i>Vermes in tubulis testacei</i>
may be tube-worms of the genus Terrebella, or a species of Serpula.
Tethya or "Sea dugge" (not "Sea dogs," as Wilkin has it) might very well
apply to <i>Ascidia</i> or one of the allied genera. Simple Ascidians,
generally known as Sea-squirts, are common littoral forms; the animals
figured by Rondeletius under the heading "De Tethyis" (p. 127) are
simple Ascidians. The <i>vesicaria marina</i>, or "fanago," might well refer
to the egg capsules of the common Whelk (<i>Buccinum undatum</i>), which are
very commonly found in masses on the shore. In his sixth <a href="#merrett_6">letter to
Merrett</a>, Browne mentions two kinds of "fanago," the first which I take
to be the egg capsules of the Whelk, resembling the "husk of peas;" the
smaller that of "barley when the flower [awn?] is mouldered away," may
possibly be the egg capsules of <i>Purpura lapillus</i>, or of some species
of Natica, which bear a fanciful resemblance to grains of barley. See
also <a href="#merrett_2">Merrett's second letter</a> in <a href="#APPENDIX_A">Appendix A.</a>, in which he describes the
Vesicaria found on oyster-shells as resembling flowers of <i>Hyacinthus
botryoides</i>, which is not a bad description of the form of the egg
capsules of <i>P. lapillus</i>.</p></div>

<p>Many riuer fishes also and animals. Salmon<a name="FNanchor_92_107" id="FNanchor_92_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_107" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> no com&#772;on fish in our

Trowes mill [ab <i>crossed out</i>] in Xtmas. whose mouths were stuck with

kept in water 3 moneths if a few drops of blood were putt to the water
they would in a litle time looke red. they sensibly grewe bigger then I
first found them and were killed by an hard froast freezing the water.
most of our Salmons haue a recurued peece of flesh in ye end of the
lower iawe wch when they shutt there mouths deepely enters the upper. as
Scaliger hath noted in some.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_92_107" id="Footnote_92_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_107"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> The Salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) is at the present day very
rarely found in our rivers, and those met with are, as a rule, male
Kelts which have strayed into unsuspected situations after floods; a
singular exception occurred on the 20th May, 1897, when one weighing 6
lbs. was taken on a fly in the river above Stoke Holy Cross Mill; this
fish is preserved in the Norwich Museum. Another curious capture of
which I heard (but did not see the fish) occurred on the 1st August,
1898, when a salmon, also of 6 lbs. weight, jumped into a small boat
towed behind a yacht which was sailing across Breydon Water. That the
salmon was at one time a recognised visitor to our rivers is evident
from the following extract from the Norwich Court of Mayoralty Book
under date 2 Novr. 1667: "It is ordered that the bell man give notice
that if any person shall take any Salmons from the Nativity of our Lady
unto St. Martin's day, or destroy any young Salmons by netts or other
ingens from the midst of April until the Nativity of St. John Baptist
shall be punished according to the law." The Salmon is the host of
several parasites both internal and external. Fresh run Salmon are
generally infested with a "Sea-louse," which quickly perishes in
freshwater; not so, however, with the troublesome worm-like creature,
the subject of Browne's experiments; it is known as <i>Lernæa salmonis</i>,
and is only found on the gill-covers of spent Kelts; it is not got rid
of till the fish returns to the salt water. Browne may be excused being
rather sceptical as to the identity of the clean run Salmon and the
spent Kelt, for no greater contrast can be imagined than that which
exists between the two&mdash;the male in the "redding" season develops the
unsightly hooked mandible, which so puzzled the worthy doctor, and both
in colour and form is as hideous an object as can be imagined. Bécard
Gallorum (not <i>Beccard gallorus</i>), <i>i.e.</i>, the fish called "Bécard" by
the French (<a href="#merrett_2">see second letter to Merrett</a>), refers to the use of a name
still applied in France to a large Cock Salmon, and "Anchorago" is the
name under which the fish was described by Scaliger, whose book I have
not seen. Dr. Günther tells me that Artedi, "Ichthyologia," Pt. v., p.
23, quotes this name as a synonym of the Salmon.</p></div>

are so well known as to require few remarks. The Bream in our rivers and
broads are very numerous and reach a large size, but of their esculent
qualities I have had no personal experience; not so, however, with the
Perch, which quite deserve Browne's high encomium. It is well known here
that this fish shows no aversion of a certain admixture of salt and
fresh water, and Mr. Lubbock ("Fauna of Norfolk") says, "the point in
Norfolk rivers where the largest are taken with most certainty is where
water begins to turn brackish from the influence of the ocean;" in
autumn the very finest are taken by angling with a shrimp, a favourite
bait in the lower parts of the Yare and Waveney. In such localities a
small shrimp (<i><ins title="Pandalus varius in original.">Hippolyte varians</ins></i>, Leach) abounds, and it is to this
favourite food that Mr. Lubbock attributes the excellence of these
Perch. Roud is the local name of the Rudd (<i>Leuciscus erythropthalmus</i>).

its abundance in the River Yare at Norwich, which he (no doubt
inadvertently) assigns to the County of "Essex"; from this locality
Caius obtained the specimen, a drawing of which he sent to Gesner under
the name of <i>Aspredo</i>. Camden assigns this fish also to Norwich, and
Spencer, in his "Marriage of the Thames and Medway," writes of the
Ruff:&mdash;</p>

few species of Lizards and Newts (Swifts) are still probably in
undiminished numbers; the Mole Cricket (<i>Gryllotalpa vulgaris</i>) is rare
with us; Horse-leeches (<i>Aulostoma gulo</i>) are frequent, and also
"Periwinkles," which I take to be various species of freshwater
Molluscs, possibly of <i>Limnæa</i>. The Hard-worm (or Hair-worm), <i>Gordius
aquaticus</i>, which refused to be generated from "horsehayres," is still
an object of wonder to the unlearned, and the Great Black Water-Beetle
(<i>Hydrophilus piceus</i>) is found; but <i>forficula</i> and <i>corculum</i> were a
puzzle, as it is evident from their association they must be aquatic
forms (and the Earwig certainly does not take to the water voluntarily),
till my friend, Mr. C. G. Barrett, referred me to the following passage
in Swammerdam's "Book of Nature," p. 93: "This is most certain that the
<i>Forficula aquatica</i> of Jonston is the true nymph of the Mordella, or
Dragon-fly,"<a name="FNanchor_O_114" id="FNanchor_O_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_114" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> Dr. Charleton in his "Onomasticon," p. 57, has
"Corculus, the Water-beetle, resembling an heart;" not very definite,
but probably the Whirligig Beetle, <i>Gyrinus natator</i>, is intended; it is
also an appellation given by some authors to "a small species of
cordiformis, or heart-shell, of a rose colour," doubtless a Cyclas or a
Pisidium. Squilla is the Freshwater Shrimp (<i>Gammarus pulex</i>), and
<i>Notonecta glauca</i>, the Waterboatman "which swimmeth on its back," is
well known.

Otters are still numerous in the broads and reed-margined rivers, and so
long as these natural fastnesses endure in their present condition they
are likely to continue so.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Although Browne's account of the Fishes is doubtless
derived from his personal observation, I have found it very
difficult in some families, such as the Cods, Rays, Gurnards,
Flat-fishes, and Gobies to identify them with the species as at
present known; in fact, they were at that time very imperfectly
differentiated, and the figures in the old authors are generally
so inexact as not to be recognisable. Ray, in 1674 ("English
Words not generally known," p. 101), thus writes of the sea
fishes, "several of them, we judge, not yet described by any
Author extant in print: indeed the writers of Natural History of
Animals living far from the Ocean, and so having never had
opportunity of seeing these kind of fishes &hellip; write very
confusedly and obscurely concerning them," a remark which I have
found abundantly verified.</p></div>

<p>Most honourd Sir,</p>

<p>[<i>Fol 14.</i>] I take ye boldnesse to salute you as a person of singular
worth &amp; learning and whom I very much respect &amp; honour. I presented my
service to you by my sonne some months past, and had thought before this
time to have done it by him again, but the time of his returne to London
being yet uncertaine, I would not deferre these at present unto you. I

have observed and taken notice of many animals in these parts whereof 3
years agoe a learned gentleman of this country desired me to give him
some account, which while I was doing ye gentleman my good friend died.
I shall only at this time present and name some few unto you which I
found not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> in your catalogue. A Trachurus [<i><a href="#Footnote_61_73">see Note 61</a></i>] which yearly
cometh before or in ye head of ye herrings called therefore an horse.
Stella marina testacea [<i><a href="#Footnote_87_102">see Note 87</a></i>] which I have often found upon the
sea-shoare, an Astacus marinus pediculi marini facie [<i><a href="#Footnote_81_96">see Note 81</a></i>]
which is sometimes taken with the lobsters at Cromer in Norfolck. a
pungitius marinus [<i><a href="#Footnote_75_88">see Note 75</a></i>] wereof I have known many taken among

<i>nucem moschatam et cinamomum vere Spirat</i> to me it smelt like roses
santalum &amp; Ambegris. I have thrice met with Mergus maximus Farensis
Clusij, [<i><a href="#Footnote_11_20">see Note 11</a></i>] and have a draught thereof. they were taken
about the time of herring fishing at yarmouth one was taken upon the
shoare not able to fly away about ten yeares agoe I sent one to Dr.
Scarborough. Twice I have met with a Skua Hoyeri [<i><a href="#Footnote_10_19">see Note 10</a></i>] the
draught whereof I also have. one was shot in a marsh which I gave unto a
gentleman which [<i>sic</i>] I can sende you another was killd feeding upon a

wherein probably there may be some mistake, for I cannot affirme nor I
doubt any other yt. is found thereabout. Some 25 yeares ago I gave an
account of this plant unto [this <i>crossed out</i>] Mr. Goodyeere:<a name="FNanchor_102_118" id="FNanchor_102_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_118" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> &amp;

of the fresh Juli. This elegant plant groweth very plentifully and
beareth its Julus yearly by the bankes of Norwich river [fol. 13
<i>verso</i>] chiefly about Claxton and Surlingham. &amp; also between norwich &amp;
Hellsden bridge so that I have known Heigham Church in the suburbes of
Norwich strowed all over with it, it hath been transplanted and set on
the sides of Marish pondes in severall places of the country where it
thrives and beareth ye Julus yearly.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_99_115" id="Footnote_99_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_99_115"><span class="label">[99]</span></a> It is evident that Merrett was collecting a considerable
amount of materials for an enlarged edition of his <i>Pinax Rerum
Naturalium Britannicarum</i>, on behalf of which Browne seems, by this
introductory letter, to have tendered his assistance, but the
contemplated edition, probably for reasons which I have mentioned
elsewhere, never appeared; happily, these rough drafts have been
preserved, although it seems not unlikely that the letters themselves,
should they ever be found, would differ from them in some respects.</p></div>

plenty in various localities in the county, but it does not appear to
develop its curious "julus" every year. It was very abundant at Heigham,
a suburb of Norwich, on the site now occupied by the goods yard of the
Midland and Great Northern Railway, and it was probably from this spot
that the supply was obtained for the purpose of littering the floor of
the old parish church. Mr. Vaux, in his "Church Folk-Lore," p. 264, says
that up to the passing of the Municipal Reform Bill the Town Clerk of
Norwich was accustomed to pay the sub-sacrist of the cathedral an amount
of one guinea for strewing the floor with rushes on the Mayor's Day. The
custom is said to have been adopted "as well for coolness as for
pleasant smell." The pleasant cinnamon-like scent of the rush, on being
trodden on, is said to have perfumed the whole building. The root was
also used as a remedy in cases of ague, and formed the base of tooth and
hair powders.</p></div>

received from Mr. John Goodyer, of Maple-Durham, in Hampshire. Sir J. E.
Smith ("Eng. Flora," iv., p. 34) speaks of him as "one of the most
deserving of our early English Botanists." Robert Brown named a genus of

<p>Honord Sr I receiued your courteous letter &amp; am sorry some diuersions
have so long delayed this my second vnto you. You are very exact in the
account of the fungi. I have met with two,<a name="FNanchor_106_123" id="FNanchor_106_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_123" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> which I have not found
in any Author, of which I have sent you a rude draught inclosed. The
first an elegant fungus Ligneus found in an hollow sallowe I haue one of
them by mee butt without a very good opportunitie dare not send it
fearing it should bee broken vnto some it seemed to resemble some noble
or princely ornament of the head &amp; so might bee called fungus Regius
vnto others a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> turret, top of a cupola or Lanterne of a building &amp; so
might bee named fungus pterygoides, pinnacularis or Lanterniformis you
may name it as you please. The second fungus Ligneus teres Antliarum or
fungus ligularis longissimus consisting [of <i>crossed out</i>] or made of
many wooddy strings about the bignesse of round poynts or Laces some
about half a yard long shooting in a bushie forme from the trees wch
serue vnderground for pumpes. I have obserued diuers especially in
norwich where wells are sunck deep for pumpes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_106_123" id="Footnote_106_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_106_123"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> Dr. Plowright informs me that "it is impossible to say
with certainty what the first named Fungus is; the description suggests
some form of Polyporus perhaps, <i>P. varius,</i> which is a ligneous species
and occurs frequently on willows in Norfolk. The second is the abortive
form of <i>Polyporus squamosus</i>, which is well figured by many of the
older botanists, for instance under the name of <i>Boletus rangiferinus</i>,
by Bolton, t. 138, and <i>Boletus squamosus</i>, var. <i>rangiferinus</i>, by
Hooker, 'Flora Londinensis,' new series. In many cases no pileus at all
is formed and it used then to be referred to Clavaria." The Phalloides
is <i>Phallus impudicus</i>, L., a very common species in this county and
even occurring in some of the city gardens where its exceedingly
offensive odour renders it very undesirable. Fungus rotundus is the
well-known <i>Lycoperdon giganteum</i>, Fr., which sometimes reaches a very
large size.</p></div>

<p>The fungus phalloides found not farre from norwich large &amp; very fetid
answering the description of Hadrianus junius I have a part of one dryed

to vrtica marina which I haue obserued in great numbers by yarmouth
after a flood &amp; easterly winds. They resemble pure crystall buttons
chamfered or welted on the sides with 2 small holes at the ends. They
cannot bee sent for the included water or thinne gelly soon runneth from
them.</p>

<p>Vrtica marina minor jonstoni [<i><a href="#Footnote_90_105">see Note 90</a></i>] I haue often found on this

the Canis carcharias alius Johnstoni. Tab. vi fig. 6.</p>

<p>Lupus marinus you mention upon an handsome experiment butt I find it not

not in figure if you please to read Johnstonus fol 101 I am not
satisfied with the conceit of some authors there that is [it?] is a
difference of male and female for all ours are thus formed. The fish is
thicker than [oth <i>crossed out</i>] ordinarie salmons and very much &amp; more

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_107_125" id="Footnote_107_125"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_125"><span class="label">[107]</span></a> Amber, writes Mr. Clement Reid, in a paper contributed by
him to the "Trans. Norf. and Nor. Nat. Soc." (iii., p. 601), "is found
on the Norfolk coast, usually mixed with the seaweed thrown up by the
Spring gales," but is very rarely found in place; as much as three or
four pounds are annually gathered near Cromer. The quality, Mr. Rein
says, is very good, but the dark transparent lumps are most generally
found. In a subsequent paper (<i>op. cit.</i>, iv., p. 248) he enumerates
seven species of insects which have been found enclosed, and in a third
communication mentions an eighth. Mr. A. S. Ford, as the result of an
examination of a collection of East-coast Amber made at Yarmouth (<i>op.
cit.</i>, v., p. 92), adds one species of Hymenoptera, three of Coleoptera,
two of Orthoptera, with some Araneida, and remains of vegetable
substances which had not been identified.
</p><p>
The Jet found on the Norfolk coast differs considerably from the Whitby
Jet, and Mr. Reid, "Geology of the Country Round Cromer" (p. 133),
believes that in all probability it was originally derived from Lower
Tertiary beds under the North Sea, a few miles from the present coast.
Mr. Savin estimates the average annual find of Jet near Cromer at from
ten to twenty pounds.
</p><p>
The doctor does not display his usual acumen when he rejects the
"ancient" opinion as to the vegetable origin of Amber, see
<i>Pseudodoxia</i>, book ii., chap. iv.; also letter from Earl of Yarmouth to
T. B. (Wilkin Edit. i., p. 411).</p></div>

narcissi</i> has been suggested, but Mr. Verrall, whom I consulted says,
"certainly not <i>Merodon</i>, which probably was not known in Britain until
about 1870," and suggests the small fly <i>Nemopoda</i>. Mr. Bloomfield
writes that the only fly of which he has seen any mention as having a
musky or "excellent fragrant odour" is <i>Sepsis cynipsea</i>, which Kirby
and Spence state on the authority of De Geer, "emits a fragrant odour of
beaum" (balm); this species is very nearly allied to Nemopoda. Several
Bees, for instance the Genus <i>Prosopis</i>, emit a strong scent of balm,
and it is possible that Browne may have used the term "fly" in what is
even now a popular sense, and that really some species of Bee may have
called forth his remarks. It will be noticed that at <a href="#Page_74">p. 74</a> he speaks of
it as a "small beelike flye."</p></div>

Ornithology escaped, was well acquainted with Sir Thomas Browne's works,
yet has in his "Birds of Norfolk" unaccountably overlooked this passage,
and remarks that Browne does not appear to have noticed this species; he
however not only refers to it as above, but evidently describes it from
his personal observation. It is a very uncertain winter visitor to this
county, but on rare occasions makes its appearance in considerable
flocks. A remarkable instance of this occurred in the winter of 1866-7,
when Mr. Stevenson, as the result of the examination of a very large
series, contributed an exhaustive paper on the plumage of this handsome
bird to the "Transactions of the Norf. and Nor. Nat. Soc.," iii., pp.
326-344.</p></div>

quite impossible to recognise the species of Diptera described by
persons unacquainted with the particular group, and that Browne's
remarks would apply to hundreds of species. It is possible that an
<i>Ephydra</i> may be meant. This genus of small flies, says Mr. Verrall,
abounds in such places as Browne describes, but it is likely that other
species were with them.</p></div>

Oliv.

<i>Gemmæ foraminatæ [formicatæ?] foliorum</i>: "pimple-like buds on the

and the common Spangle, <i>N. lenticularus</i>, Oliv.
</p><p>
<i>Excrementum fungosum verticibus scatens</i>: "a spongy secretion bursting
out from the ends of the shoots." The Oak Apple, <i>Biorhiza terminalis</i>,
Fab.
</p><p>
<i>Excrementum lanatum</i>: the Woolly Gall, <i>Andricus ramuli</i>, L., a
somewhat rare Gall, resembling a ball of cotton-wool.
</p><p>
<i>Capitula squamosa jacææ æmula</i>: "little scaley (or imbricated) heads
resembling the heads of Jacea" (Black Knapweed). The Artichoke Gall.
<i>Andricus fecundatrix</i>; Htg.
</p><p>
<i>Nodi</i>: probably swellings of any sort, whether caused by insects or
not.
</p><p>
<i>Melleus liquor</i>: Honey-dew, a secretion of Aphides.
</p><p>
<i>Tubera radicum vermibus scatentia</i>: "swollen tubers on the roots
containing grubs;" without doubt the Root-Gall, <i>Andricus radicis</i>, Fab.
Polythalamous Galls, often very large at the roots or on the trunk near
the ground.
</p><p>
Mosses, Lichens, and Fungi, all "genuine products of the Oak," need no
comment, but Mr. Bloomfield remarks, "How wonderfully observant Sir
Thomas Browne must have been thus to distinguish the various galls, &amp;c.,
and to point them out so distinctly."
</p><p>
Browne's contemporary, Dean Wren, seems sadly to have misunderstood the
fructification of the Oak. In a note on Browne's remarks on the
"Miseltoe" (<i>Pseudodoxia</i>, book ii., chap. vi.), he says, "Arboreous
excrescences of the Oak are soe many as may raise the greatest wonder.
Besides the gall, which is his proper fruite, hee shootes out oakerns,
i.e., <i>ut nunc vocamus</i> (acornes), and oakes apples, and polypodye, and
moss; five several sorts of excrescences." See also letter to his son,
Dr. Edward Browne, in which Sir Thomas Browne says that "wee haue little
or none of <i>viscus quercinus</i>, or miselto of the oake, in this country;
butt I beleeve they have in the woods and parks of
Oxfordshyre."&mdash;Wilkin, i, p. 279.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p></div>

distinguished from the Corallines, and both were regarded as vegetable

descriptions even to which section those mentioned belong, but although
our exposed coast-line is not favourable to such growths, there are a
few common species of Hydroid Zoophytes which abound here, and to these,
fortunately, Browne's specimens appear to belong. What he calls the
"Sea-perriwig" is doubtless <i>Sertularia operculata</i>, Lin., sometimes
known as "Sea-hair," a very common and widely dispersed species.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p></div>

which he suggests at <a href="#Page_75">p. 75</a> that this may be a "difference," is most
likely <i>Sertularia abietina</i>, Lin., which this species resembles, but is
less regularly pinnate; this may have led him to suppose that the
"sprouts, wings, or leaves" may have fallen off. The <i>Fucus marinus</i> is

seashore at certain seasons of the year, and under the conditions which
Browne describes. The Pagets ("Nat. Hist. of Great Yarmouth") mention
that the fly, <i>Actora æstuum</i>, is common on the beach at high-water
mark; but Mr. Verrall writes me that there are many others likely to be
thus met with, such as <i>Orygma luctuosa</i> and <i>Limosina zosteræ</i>, widely
divergent species. In his "Journal of a Tour" into Derbyshire, Dr.
Edward Browne, in crossing the sands of the Wash, mentions his
satisfaction at the absence of the swarms of flies "with which all the
fenne countrys are extremely pestered." <i><a href="#Footnote_110_128">See also Note 110 supra.</a></i></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_116_134" id="Footnote_116_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_134"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> It is impossible to form an idea as to what is here
intended. I know of no <i>Juncus</i> which would answer the description.
Professor Newton reminds me that "Junco" was a common name for "a bird
that inhabited reeds," and was loosely applied, some old authors taking
it to be the Reed Thrush (<i>i.e.</i>, the Great Reed-Warbler of these days),
and others, the Reed-Sparrow or Bunting. But bearing in mind Browne's
practice of referring to Jonston, it seems possible that the latter's
<i>Junco</i> may be here intended, and that, as the figure (pl. 53) shows, is
a small Sandpiper, almost certainly the Dunlin. It is lettered "Junco
Bellonii," but this he must have taken second-hand from Aldrovandus,
since Belon never used the word "Junco" in this connexion, but called it
"Sch&oelig;niclus" or "Alouette-de-mer"&mdash;terms rendered <i>Junco</i> by
Aldrovandus (iii. p. 487). Charleton took the same view in his
"Onomasticon" (p. 108), published in 1668 (the year assigned as that of
this letter), stating that it was so-called because "in juncis libenter
degat," and identifying it with the <i>Alouette-de-mer</i> of the French, and
the English "Stint, or Sparr, or Perr." Gilbert White appears to have
thus applied the term (<i>cf.</i> "Life" by Rashleigh Holt-White, i. pp. 186,
194, 250). In one place he says, "No. five is Ray's <i>Junco</i> and the
<i>Turdus arundinaceus</i> of Linn." That "Junco" is the name of a bird is
absolutely certain, but the context, "very white when fresh," does not
seem to admit of explanation.</p></div>

Domestication," i., p. 78), that from the time of Aristotle to the
present day, Solid-hoofed Swine have been occasionally observed in
various parts of the world. Dr. Coues also says that this variety seems
to be persistent in a Texas breed. See also Professor Struthers in the
"Edin. New Phil. Journal," April, 1863. The two distal phalanges of the
two great toes, both front and back, in the examples described by
Professor Struthers, were joined together, forming a single hoof-bearing
bone. The next two phalanges were separate, and sometimes kept widely
apart from each other by the introduction of a special ossicle. I have
been told that about the year 1827, a breed of solid-footed swine
existed at or near Upwell. By some it was thought that their flesh was
not good for food because they were "uncloven." Dr. Wren, in a note to
Browne's <i>Pseudodoxia</i> (book vi., chap. x.), says, "About Aug., 1625, at
a farm 4 miles from Winchester, I beheld with wonder a great heard of
swine, whole-footed, and taller than any other that ever I sawe."</p></div>

following note on this puzzling passage. "Jonston's figure (tab. 31) of
<i>Gallina hypoleucos</i>, to which Browne says it bore some resemblance,
undoubtedly represents what we know as the Common Sandpiper, <i>Totanus
hypoleucus</i> or <i>Actitis hypoleuca</i>, the <i>Fysterlin</i> of the Germans of
Jonston's time (p. 160), and <i>Fisterlein</i> or <i>Pfisterlein</i> of modern

cleared, between this bird and Browne's <i>Anatula</i> or <i>Mergulus
melanoleucos</i> [<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_76">p. 76</a> <i>ante</i>], of which some years later, he sent a
drawing, under the latter name, to Willughby, in whose work it is
described and figured (Lat. Ed. p. 261, Engl. 343, tab. lix.), for this
most certainly is the Rotche or Little Auk, <i>Mergulus alle</i> of modern
ornithology." In the next letter (<a href="#Page_81">p. 81</a>), Browne mentions that he

was sent from y<sup>e</sup> Sussex shore, hee had only tryed it to its electricity
&amp; found it answer his expectation, farther tryals will be made of it.
The second is a small plant found on oyster shells which when fresh did
perfectly represent y<sup>e</sup> flowers off Hyacinthus botryoides, [<i><a href="#Footnote_91_106">see Note

are now shrunk &amp; y<sup>e</sup> sides constituting y<sup>e</sup> cavity come together &amp;
appear only a transparent husk. One thing more I had to add (but
scarcely dare speak it out) y<sup>t</sup> is if it would please [you <i>added

without y<sup>r</sup> trouble, then I would beg off y<sup>w</sup> to set some a work to

Sperm&#772;e but in his heade and that after I had taken off his scalpe one
tonn weight [or more <i>written above</i>] of a nexuous substance, we found
in the circumference as large as a small coach wheele in the middle part
certain round pieces of Sperm as bigge as a mans fist some as large as
eggs and on the out side of the said rounds, flakes as large as a mans
head in forme like hony combs being very white and full of oyle. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>

<p class="center">["<span class="smcap">Eastern Counties Collectanea</span>," pp. 193-195].</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The letter referred to in the foot-note on page 33, written by
Sir Thomas Browne to Dugdale, and formerly in the possession of
the late Mr. Arthur Preston of Norwich, whose collection of
manuscripts was dispersed by auction in August, 1888, was
printed in a brief-lived and little-known local publication,
entitled the "Eastern Counties Collectanea" (1872-3), at page
193. In this letter occurs a passage which confirms the doubt
expressed as to the Whales which had young ones after coming on
shore at Hunstanton being Sperm Whales. They are expressly said
to have been of that sort "which seamen call a Grampus," and as
Sir Nicholas le Strange, in a MS. preserved in the Muniment room
at Hunstanton, applies the name "Grampus" to an undoubted
specimen of <i>Hyperoodon rostratus</i> (as shown both by his
description and outline sketch) which came ashore there in the
year 1700, I have little doubt that the Cetaceans in question
belonged to that species and not to <i>Physeter macrocephalus</i>.</p>

<p>This letter is interesting also as filling a gap in Wilkin's
series and I therefore reproduce it, omitting only occasional
learned digressions which do not affect the subject. The
original not being available, I have used the copy in the
"Collectanea" before mentioned.</p>

<p>Dugdale, in November, 1658, and again later, had written to
Browne, sending him a bone of a "fish which was taken up by Sir
Robert Cotton, in digging a pond at the skirt of Conington
downe," and asking his opinion thereof. (Wilkin, i., pp. 385 and
390.)</p>

<p>To the first of these letters Browne replied, under date of the
6th December, 1658, "I receaued the bone of the fish, and shall
giue you some account of it when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> I have compared it with
another bone which is not by mee" (op. cit. p. 387). The letter
which follows and which was unknown to Wilkin supplies this
information.</p></div>

<p>[p. 193.] "Sr I cannot sufficiently admire the ingenious industry of Sr
Robert Cotton in preserving so many things of rarity and observation nor
commend your own enquiries for the satisfaction of such particulars. The
petrified bone you sent me, which with divers others was found
underground, near Cunnington, seems to be the vertebra, spondyle or
rackbone of some large fish, and no terrestrious animal as some upon
sight conceived, as either of Camel, rhinoceros, or elephant, for it is
not perforated and hollow but solid according to the spine of fishes in
whom the spinal marrow runs in a channel above these solid racks, or
spondiles.</p>

<p>"It seems much too big for the largest Dolphins, porpoises, or sword
fishes, and too little for a true or grown whale, but may be the bone of
some big cetaceous animal, as particularly of that which seamen call a
Grampus; a kind of small whale, whereof some come short, some exceed
twenty foot. And not only whales but Grampusses have been taken in this
Estuarie or mouth of the fenland rivers. And about twenty years ago four
were run ashore near Hunstanton and two had young ones after they came
to land. But whether this fish were of the longitude of twenty foot (as
is conceived) some doubt may be made for this bone containeth little
more than an inch in thickness, and not three inches in breadth so that
it might have a greater number thereof than is easily allowable to make
out that longitude. For of the whale which was cast upon our coast about
six years ago a vertebra or rackbone still preserved, containeth a foot
in breadth and nine inches in depth, yet the whale with all advantages
but sixty-two foot in length. [p, 194.] We are not ready to believe
that, wherever such relics of fish or sea animals are found, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> sea
hath had its course. And Goropius Becanus<a name="FNanchor_131_151" id="FNanchor_131_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_151" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> long ago could not digest
that conceit when he found great numbers of shells upon the highest
Alps. For many may be brought unto places where they were not first
found.</p>

<p>"Some bones of our whale were left in several fields which when the
earth hath obscured them, may deceive some hereafter, that the sea hath
come so high. In northern nations where men live in houses of fishbones
and in the land of the Icthiophagi near the Red sea where mortars were
made of the backbones of whales, doors of their jaws, and arches of
their ribs, when time hath covered them they might confound after
discoverers.&hellip;</p>

<p>"For many years great doubt was made concerning those large bones found
in some parts of England, and named Giants' bones till men [p. 195]
considered they might be the bones of elephants brought into this island
by Claudius, and perhaps also by some succeeding emperors [then follow
other ancient examples of the finding 'elephants bones' in various
countries attributed to similar modes of introduction]. But many things
prove obscure in subterraneous discovery.&hellip;</p>

<p>"In some chalk pits about Norwich many stag's horns are found of large
beams and branches, the solid parts converted into a chalky and fragile
substance, the pithy part sometimes hollow and full of brittle earth and
clay. In a churchyard of this city an oaken billet was found in a
coffin. About five years ago an humourous man of this country after his
death and according to his own desire was wrap't up in a horned hide of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
